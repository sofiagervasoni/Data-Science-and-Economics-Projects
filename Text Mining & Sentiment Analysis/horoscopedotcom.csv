"Feb 4, 2022 - If there's something crafty or artsy you've had your eye on and would really like to get but can't afford, Aries, consider making it. Even if you don't consider yourself artistic, you may surprise yourself if you give a project half a chance. There are numerous websites that cater to novices and can give you the support and instruction you need. Don't dismiss your ability. Explore this avenue and see about finding a creative niche for yourself.",Aries
"Feb 5, 2022 - Today may bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Aries. With this, verbal communication is also more likely to be effective. Consider seizing this energy by making a point of talking through any problems or issues you have with those in your life. If they don't live with you, see about driving over to visit them or calling them up to work things out. If there isn't anything pressing, see about expressing your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.",Aries
"Feb 6, 2022 - Don't fall into the ""poor me"" trap today, Aries. When things repeatedly don't go the way you want, or bad things happen to you, it can be very easy to fall into a victim mentality. Yet while we can’t always control what happens around and to us, we always have the choice as to how we're going to handle it. Grieving can be a critical element to healing, but there's a fine line. Choose to keep going and insist on being better to yourself.",Aries
"Feb 7, 2022 - Today is a good day to think about your ambitions, Aries. Considering what you really want out of life can be instrumental in setting goals and making dreams come true. Reaching them can often be as simple as making a decision and taking that first step. For example, if your dream is to have your ideal partner, and you're with someone who isn't, the practical choice is to end the current relationship. Fear, worry, and lack of confidence are the things that can keep you from moving.",Aries
"Feb 8, 2022 - Your ability to concentrate will be enhanced today, Aries. If you have studying or detailed work to tend to, this will be an opportune time to get to it. Hobbies that require a lot of focus may also strike your fancy. Even if a herd of stampeding elephants runs through your space, you aren’t likely to lose your concentration. Pull out your most intensive tasks and have a great day.",Aries
"Feb 9, 2022 - Today you can expect some noticeable changes in your neighborhood, Aries. Some new neighbors who might become your friends could be moving in. This could alter your life ever so subtly, turning it in a more positive direction. You could click immediately with these new people, realizing that they share a lot of your interests. Don't overanalyze this situation, but don't write it off as coincidence either. Just make the most of it!",Aries
"Feb 10, 2022 - News could come your way, perhaps through local magazines or newspapers, about possible renovations occurring in your community. These changes could be rather controversial, Aries, so don't be surprised if you hear a lot of gossip and a number of opinions, both pro and con, on the matter. You might want to delve more deeply into the facts before forming an opinion of your own. This could prove quite enlightening!",Aries
"Feb 11, 2022 - Books, lectures, and other sources of information regarding spiritual, metaphysical, or religious matters could have your mind spinning, Aries. What you read or hear is likely to be fascinating, but you might be too overwhelmed to make sense of it right now. Don't feel that you have to get it all together today. Do something else, let it all stew, and tomorrow its meaning could all appear to you in a rush.",Aries
"Feb 12, 2022 - Missed connections and unfortunate misunderstandings will happen less frequently if you slow down and focus. Remember that you can do things yourself, Aries. Don't feel like you absolutely need approval from others before tackling the projects that you wish to complete. Your mind is urging you to take the initiative today, so feel free to do so. Just make sure you aren't too hasty in your actions. You’ll be more productive if you think before you act.",Aries
"Feb 13, 2022 - Group activities might prove a little unsettling for you today, Aries. Animated discussions could turn into angry quarrels and this could offend your desire for harmony. A lot of misinformation could be exchanged today and cause confusion and short tempers. Stay home if you can, but if you must go out, don't be afraid to leave at the first sign of arguments. They aren't likely to accomplish much after that anyway.",Aries
"Feb 14, 2022 - A chance to travel, perhaps for business purposes, could present itself to you today, Aries. This might require some temporary adjustments in your personal life, but don't let this stop you. You'll want to make the most of whatever new opportunities come your way at this time. Career success is highly indicated, and this could make a profound and positive difference in the course of your life. Go for the gold!",Aries
"Feb 15, 2022 - Studying some paperwork involving your finances could bring a pleasant surprise. You’re better off than you thought, Aries! Dividends or benefits of some kind might be forthcoming. You could decide to treat yourself, buy some gifts for your family, or perhaps do some work on your home. Do take care to avoid impulse buying, and don't go crazy spending. You don't want your funds to disappear as quickly as they came!",Aries
"Feb 16, 2022 - Some rather unsettling communications could come your way today, perhaps from out of state. This isn't likely to be anything serious, Aries, but it could be enough to put your nose a little out of joint. Changes in your neighborhood might interfere with your daily routine. A neighbor or relative could be ill and you might feel obligated to help them out a little. This is fine as long as you don't commit to too much.",Aries
"Feb 17, 2022 - Books and movies may inspire you to get involved in artistic activities. Your aesthetic sense is very high today, Aries, and you may be drawing your inspiration from the higher realms. You might want to stroll through an art gallery or museum and try to sense the feelings of those from the past. A warm and loving letter or phone call could come from a romantic partner, elevating your mood even more. It’s a very emotionally gratifying day.",Aries
"Feb 18, 2022 - Is your boss a woman, Aries? If so, stay out of her way today. To put it mildly, she isn’t in a good mood. Work hard, be very sweet to everyone, and make copious use of your innate diplomacy. You may be on the receiving end of some sharp words, but by remaining focused and continuing your routine in your usual efficient manner, you should avoid any major blowups. Try to stay calm, and hope she goes home early!",Aries
"Feb 19, 2022 - Too much exposure to books, newspapers, and computers today could produce eyestrain headaches, Aries, so try to exercise a little caution when working with small print or computer text. Thoughts of love and romance could interfere with your ability to do your work effectively. You may be tempted to spend most of your time on the phone. We all have days like this, so don't fight it. Just make sure you're feeling great when the evening rolls around!",Aries
"Feb 20, 2022 - Dark, depressing dreams could plague your sleep tonight, Aries, probably alternating with silly ones that make you laugh out loud. You could wake in the morning totally confused by these images, and your tendency might be to dismiss them. Don't do this. Your dreams are trying to tell you something about yourself. Have you had your emotional ups and downs lately? Have you alternately laughed and cried over something? Think about it!",Aries
"Feb 21, 2022 - Your efforts on the domestic front have certainly paid off, Aries. Your home is looking wonderful. Everyone who enters says so. Some unexpected visitors may stop by for a quick hello and wind up staying for dinner. You are a natural, gracious host, not to mention a great cook. Who can blame your guests for wanting to stay?",Aries
"Feb 22, 2022 - It's hard to deny the power of a chemical reaction to another person. You’ll likely meet someone today or perhaps you've just met someone who has a strong influence on you, Aries. You can’t get this person out of your mind. It isn’t clear whether this is a one-time fling or a long-term romance. Whatever it turns out to be, you’re thrilled to be feeling so excited and alive.",Aries
"Feb 23, 2022 - Disappointment in a prominent public figure you've always admired could cause an ethical crisis today, Aries. You might find yourself doubting beliefs and values that you've accepted without question for most of your life. Bear in mind that this is actually a healthy process. By tomorrow you'll probably have made peace with yourself, and should have done some growing up in the meantime. Hang in there!",Aries
"Feb 24, 2022 - Prosperity is just around the corner, Aries, if it isn’t here already. All your efforts are about to pay off and in a big way. It may be that a big proposal gets accepted at work, or perhaps a manuscript that you've penned lands you a publisher. Your innate talent and good fortune combine to bring wonderful things your way. Enjoy this welcome change of events!",Aries
"Feb 25, 2022 - An intense passion has been released within you, Aries. You find it hard to resist the urge to take your loved one and run away to some deserted island. You could use a break from civilization. But if you can't quite make it to that island, how about creating an oasis right in your own home? Order some food from your favorite restaurant, bring it home, and enjoy an intimate evening with your partner.",Aries
"Feb 26, 2022 - Beware lawyers, bankers, and stockbrokers today, Aries. One of them is likely to try and mislead you with some inaccurate information. While it might be in his or her best interests for you to take this information at face value, it certainly isn't in yours! Do your own research and get all the facts before making the financial investments recommended to you.",Aries
"Feb 27, 2022 - An unexpected conversation with a current or potential romantic partner could end with both of you revealing a lot of your deepest feelings, Aries. This discussion may only indirectly concern the status of your relationship, but you will learn a lot about each other that could cause you to seriously consider whether or not you want to continue the relationship. However, all signs indicate that the relationship might change slightly but will continue.",Aries
"Feb 28, 2022 - You want nothing more than to be alone today. For that to happen, Aries, you need to turn off your phone, shut off the computer, and hang a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. Even then, your friends are likely to walk past the sign and ask what's for dinner. It's one of those days. People want to congregate and they want to do it at your house. Order your favorite comfort food and enjoy the chaos!",Aries
"Feb 4, 2023 - Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Aries. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues. You might be a bit edgy emotionally and more likely to overreact when other people quarrel or machines break down. It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.",Aries

"Mar 1, 2022 - Today could be a strange day where money is concerned, Aries. You might not be sure exactly where you stand financially, so it might be a good idea to get all your records together and go over them carefully. This isn't a good day for gambling or making investments of any kind. Instead, get whatever information you can on investments that interest you, study them, and make appropriate decisions later.",Aries
"Mar 2, 2022 - You're asked to spring into action today, Aries, so don't resist it. Be aware of the fact that things may not be as they seem. There could be a strange façade over the situation that you should be aware of before you act. Your head may seem a bit clouded. Your fantasy world is especially active today, so you might feel the urge to run away and never come back. That might not be a bad idea.",Aries
"Mar 3, 2022 - You might have planned an exciting evening with friends or your current love interest, but you have to postpone it due to forces beyond your control. This could prove both disappointing and frustrating, Aries, but there won't be much you can do about it. Just reschedule and plan something else for tonight. Distracting yourself might be the best way to go. See a movie or play on your own.",Aries
"Mar 4, 2022 - You should be feeling especially creative at this time. Social events could put you in touch with some exciting new people, Aries. Contact with those in interesting professions could open up new personal and intellectual avenues to explore today. New friends could come your way, and your romantic situation should intensify. Expect some exciting discussions and the opportunity to learn more about the professions and personalities of the people around you.",Aries
"Mar 5, 2022 - Decisions don't have to be as hard as you make them, Aries. You may feel as if a strong force is pulling you in a clear direction, so don't resist it. You'll only drive yourself crazy trying to list all the reasons why you should or shouldn't go the way you're destined to go. Make things easier on yourself by going with the flow instead of letting your mind interfere with constant chatter and resistance.",Aries
"Mar 6, 2022 - Take advantage of the creative energy in the air today, Aries. Keep your hands moving and your imagination flowing toward something fun and artistic. If you begin to doubt your work, you may fall down a spiral of creative blockage. Don't get into the habit of constantly judging the quality or outcome of your work. Give yourself free rein to open up and explore whatever comes to mind.",Aries
"Mar 7, 2022 - A radical force seems to be stirring up trouble and challenging your long-established beliefs about how things should be done and what you hold most dear, Aries. The truth is that what you might see as trouble is really a growing pain to be endured as you move to the next step in your personal evolution. Change is often difficult; however, this is what you're being called upon to do.",Aries
"Mar 8, 2022 - Communication with a significant other might hit a brick wall, and you may not be able to get through. Money could be coming in the mail, Aries, but probably won't arrive today. This could be a day full of frustrations, but the evening should make up for it. Love and romance look great right now. This is a wonderful day to schedule an evening with your partner - or to look for one. Enjoy!",Aries
"Mar 9, 2022 - A strong desire to bring more of the fantasy realm into your own reality spurs your actions today, Aries. You could discover that there is an intense desire to bring a sense of the obscure to the normal, everyday realm. You want to show people that life really is just one big comedy act. Encourage others to not take life so seriously. Be creative in your approach to helping people lighten up.",Aries
"Mar 10, 2022 - A great sense of duty toward your fellow humans is likely to drive your actions, Aries. Think of yourself as an important role model for young people. They may look up to you without you even knowing it. Make sure you stand up straight and proudly whether or not you consider your job menial. The example you set is likely to have a trickle-down effect that will end up touching many people.",Aries
"Mar 11, 2022 - In some ways, today could seem like a day of reckoning for you, Aries. You might look in the mirror and see things that you really aren't very happy with. Perhaps you harbor a sense of shame based on past events that still linger in your mind. Don't let this shadow of insecurity continue to dwell in your life. Work through these feelings and identify the root of the problem.",Aries
"Mar 12, 2022 - Be prepared for all-out combat with people today, Aries, even though this is pretty much the opposite of your normal style. In fact, ""opposite"" is the name of the game for you today. Don't be surprised if you walk into an ice cream shop wanting vanilla and all they have is chocolate. Remember to not get upset by these types of situations over which you simply have no control.",Aries
"Mar 13, 2022 - Some interesting information could come to you from another state or country, Aries. This could induce some pretty deep thinking, leading to decisions that could alter the course of your life in some way. You might be considering returning to school to advance your education. Your mood today should be optimistic and positive. You could be full of utopian schemes for the future. Wait a few days and then start to make definite plans.",Aries
"Mar 14, 2022 - Today is wonderful for surrounding yourself with those you love the most, Aries. Host a get-together with family and friends, full of stimulating conversation and delicious food and drink. However, you might at some point feel a little sad, missing someone who should be with you but isn't, and speculating about what he or she may be doing. Concentrate on those there with you. You're surrounded by love and are likely to remain so.",Aries
"Mar 15, 2022 - Relationships with others are important to you, Aries. As a result, you've learned to be polite and congenial. Social engagements today could give you a chance to use your people skills. You could not only make some new friends but also valuable contacts. These activities could keep you away from home and family longer than you'd like, but you'll end the day with a strong sense of accomplishment.",Aries
"Mar 16, 2022 - If you look carefully today, Aries, you're apt to notice aspects of people that you never noticed before. There could be a frenzy of activity that catches you in its net and takes you away. Look to other people for guidance as you go along. When you ask for help, you'll get it. At the same time, you'll learn a great deal about the people who end up helping you.",Aries
"Mar 17, 2022 - A couple with a child might visit you today. One or both of these people could be connected with you in a business capacity. Whatever the connection, Aries, a lot of interesting discussion should take place, and promising plans for the future could well be made. Take care not to stay up too late, however. Your mind could go a thousand miles an hour and you'll need to unwind so you can sleep!",Aries
"Mar 18, 2022 - Trust that you have all the facts you need today, Aries. You should be feeling quite good, emotionally. Use this self-confidence to make great strides in whatever you want to accomplish. Have fun letting your mind drift to a fanciful world where it can explore your imaginative proclivities. Feel free to use your strong hold on facts as a base to take off into a highly creative and intuitive realm.",Aries
"Mar 19, 2022 - Dreams with mixed messages might trouble your sleep tonight. One minute you'll be having a wonderful dream, and the next could be black and gloomy. Write them down, Aries. The message is probably more positive than it appears. Worries about money might plague you throughout the day, yet things probably aren't as bad as they seem. Make sure you learn the facts about your situation before allowing yourself to panic!",Aries
"Mar 20, 2022 - You may appear to have your head in the clouds today, Aries. The truth is, you've got a lot of important things on your mind. Others might be offended or even amused at your distance. Try not to worry about this too much. You need to take care of resolving those problems you've been ruminating on before worrying about everyone else's reaction.",Aries
"Mar 21, 2022 - Extra money may come your way today as a reward for work well done. Perhaps you're getting a substantial bonus, or maybe you're slated for a significant raise. Either way, Aries, you're going to be in pretty good financial shape. You're going to be feeling very optimistic about your future, and therefore your relations with others will be warm and congenial. Spend the evening celebrating!",Aries
"Mar 22, 2022 - Long-term investments, especially those involving real estate, could pay off now, Aries. If you've been thinking of buying or selling a home, this is the time to do it. All signs indicate that your patience is likely to bear fruit, so at least one of your longtime goals should bring success right now. Also, if you've been considering investing some money in your house, such as remodeling or building an addition, start planning today.",Aries
"Mar 23, 2022 - Someone or something has disappeared, Aries. Gossip could spread like wildfire as everyone imagines the worst. Listening to rumors probably doesn't appeal to your sense of fairness; nonetheless, you're wondering, too. Your comrades will probably experience a mixture of relief and disappointment when this person/thing turns up. Mystery (mostly) solved!",Aries
"Mar 24, 2022 - A letter or phone call regarding money that you may be expecting may still not come today, Aries. This could put you in a panic and cause you to want to phone those responsible to see what's going on. Don't be surprised if you end up playing phone tag. This just isn't a good day for any sort of communication. Your call will come. Just hang in there for a day or two more.",Aries
"Mar 25, 2022 - Intuition enhances communications of all kinds today, Aries. If you've been thinking about doing some writing, this is the day to get started. Your mind is particularly expansive, and your imagination is working at a very high level. Insights that might not normally come to you add new depth and dimension to your writing, whether a poem, novel, article, or letter to a friend. Make the most of it!",Aries
"Mar 26, 2022 - The planetary energy makes this a good day for contemplation rather than action, Aries. If you feel the urge to buy, don't. Sleep on decisions. If you feel the same tomorrow, go for it. If you're in the middle of a conflict at work, try not to take sides. Tell anyone who asks your opinion that you need time to think about it. Consider scheduling an hour of meditation. The word for today is Zen!",Aries
"Mar 27, 2022 - If you're single, Aries, a new love could appear right there in your neighborhood. The person should be attractive, intelligent, free spirited, and very much attracted to you! You could meet this person in an unusual way and end up spending time together and making plans to spend more. Take care not to move too quickly. You won't want this new relationship to be like a meteor, burning out as quickly as it appeared.",Aries
"Mar 28, 2022 - If you own your own home, Aries, you may learn today that its value has increased substantially. If you don't own a home but want to buy one, this is the time to start looking. Any investments made now, particularly in land, will probably be solid and apt to gain in value, although results might take some time to materialize. Carefully consider all contingencies before committing, however. This isn't the time to act impulsively.",Aries
"Mar 29, 2022 - Expanding your horizons is definitely on the agenda today, Aries. Travel, education, creativity – they're all coming to the forefront of your concerns. Romance should also be going well. A friend could introduce you to a new interest, and children might also be a source of joy. Happiness reigns as you're able to spend more time pursuing the concerns that mean the most to you. Any mundane irritations notwithstanding, this should be a beautiful day.",Aries
"Mar 30, 2022 - Expect a hectic pace today, Aries. Some of your colleagues may have been procrastinating a little and now everything has to be done at once. Don't get too frustrated, however. There are unspoken reasons for their behavior that they haven't shared with you. Just do the best you can and hope that others will as well. If some of it has to wait, it won't be the end of the world!",Aries
"Mar 31, 2022 - Are your views about certain intellectual or spiritual matters slowly changing, Aries? If so, you may not be all that comfortable with the changes. Traditional values and ideas could seem especially attractive to you today, so your resistance could be greater than normal. Yet you know you can't stay the same way forever. Give yourself a break today. Tomorrow you'll be back in the groove and on your way to transforming.",Aries
"Apr 1, 2022 - Freedom is a key aspect of life today, Aries. You might find that your brain wants to break free and pursue more independent ways of thinking. Don't worry if such ways of thinking lead you into unknown territory. This is a sign that this is probably where you need to be. Your witty banter could take a sudden twist that surprises both you and the people you're talking to.",Aries
"Apr 2, 2022 - You're likely to have tremendous concentration that seems to have materialized out of nowhere. Use this to your advantage, Aries, because it may not last long. You're usually blown from one thing to another like a leaf in the wind, and it's hard for you to settle on one project or issue for an extended time. You may have to shut a few people out in order to finish some tasks, but that's fine. Do what you have to do.",Aries
"Apr 3, 2022 - You could be teetering between the real world and a fantasy realm, Aries. The fantasy world is more than likely the one that wins out, but that doesn't mean you should lose all touch with reality. If anyone can bridge these two worlds, it's you. You'll probably find yourself drawn to art, which can wonderfully bridge the two. Indeed, your creative juices are gushing like a waterfall today.",Aries
"Apr 4, 2022 - Feeling grumpy lately, Aries? Don't fret, because your bad mood won't last. This attitude is unlike you. Co-workers notice your change in personality but still treat you with consideration and respect. You're fortunate to be able to draw upon a considerable wealth of kindness and good karma that you have built up over the years. Your friends and loved ones treat your mood as an aberration, which is exactly what it is.",Aries
"Apr 5, 2022 - If you have grievances about your love life, Aries, today is the day to speak up. Indeed, today requires only total honesty and forthrightness in all areas. You can expect to confront ""the other,"" whether it's your mate or co-worker, on the basis of truth and righteousness. Rest assured you'll command his or her attention! Be careful that the weight of your words doesn't surpass that of your thoughts.",Aries
"Apr 6, 2022 - A number of great ideas either for new creative projects or enhancing ongoing ones could pop into your head during the day, Aries. If you don't write them down immediately, they could just as easily pop right out again, never to return! With all your responsibilities, you could have a rather frantic day as your mind constantly shifts from one focus to another. Stay with it. You can handle it.",Aries
"Apr 7, 2022 - Today your mind should be especially quick and penetrating, Aries. You could decide to tackle some in-depth research that you've been considering doing for a while on a subject that fascinates you. You might also want to discuss the subject with someone close to you who shares this interest. Don't be surprised if you come up with some intriguing insights. Write everything down. You may want to make use of it later.",Aries
"Apr 8, 2022 - Your artistic abilities could seem a bit blocked today, Aries. You could be anxious to complete a half-finished project, but at this point you may have no idea where to go with it. Don't panic! Do something else for a day or two and ideas will probably flow as if by magic. If you don't have a tight deadline, there's no rush to complete the work now. Give it some time!",Aries
"Apr 9, 2022 - Your energy is probably pretty low today, Aries. You won't feel like socializing, nor will you feel like staying in and reading or watching TV. Chances are you won't know what to do with yourself all day. Under these circumstances, the best thing to do is find a distraction. Go work out, read a thrilling book, go to a funny movie. Get your mind off your lethargy and it could well disappear.",Aries
"Apr 10, 2022 - Are you considering moving to a new residence, redecorating, or making some home improvements, Aries? If so, this is a good time to do it. These types of projects promise to go well, so don't let doubt get in your way. Explore every possibility, consider all the pros and cons, and then if it looks like it's going to work, go for it!",Aries
"Apr 11, 2022 - In future years, you might remember today as one of the best days of your life, Aries. Romance should be going beautifully. You could exchange deeply felt words of love with your partner. The future looks bright, and you should be full of enthusiastic plans for pursuing what you really want to do. You should also be feeling especially strong, energetic, healthy, and ready to try anything. A journey could be coming up soon.",Aries
"Apr 12, 2022 - You could be overwhelmed with information today, Aries, as you receive more phone calls and email messages than you can possibly answer. Be clear about your priorities and stick with them. Otherwise, you're likely to spend the day being batted around the court like a tennis ball. Take a lot of deep breaths throughout the day and make an effort to keep your temper in check.",Aries
"Apr 13, 2022 - Today you could discover a talent for investment, real estate, or other form of money management that you never thought you had, Aries. The opportunity to make an investment or cash in on one could enable you to take strides toward making your money grow. This might be a good time to buy or sell any type of property. You might also want to do some reading on future investment opportunities.",Aries
"Apr 14, 2022 - You might want to straighten up the house this morning, Aries. Some unexpected visitors could drop by. With no warning, you could be serving lunch or dinner to a group of ten! Don't panic. Take-out was created for just such an occasion. Pull out the linens from the back of the closet, make a few calls to your favorite bakery or restaurant, and voilà! The meal is served.",Aries
"Apr 15, 2022 - You could be startled to find that your artistic talents, although dormant for a while, are called into service today. A particular undertaking of those around you could benefit from your gift in this area. Don't panic, Aries, you won't be expected to do this alone. Others will pitch in and help. One thing to be careful of today is not let your emotions run away with you. It could spoil everything.",Aries
"Apr 16, 2022 - Today is filled with socializing, with a strong emphasis on the exchange of information. If you're attending a party this evening, Aries, be receptive to anyone you meet. It's likely that someone new will arrive who will have a significant impact on your life. It might be that he or she tips you off about a professional opportunity at work. It's even possible that this person will turn into a romantic interest. You never know!",Aries
"Apr 17, 2022 - You're a conscientious, hard worker, Aries, but today your thoughts are more on home than work. You feel especially close to your family and friends. They mean the most to you. Jobs and even careers come and go, but friends and family are forever. Enjoy being with them today. Gather everyone together and order too much Chinese take-out. It's just fine if you restart your diet tomorrow.",Aries
"Apr 18, 2022 - Today, Aries, forget socializing, working, and answering the phone. Stay home and cuddle in a blanket by the fire. Get out your old yearbooks or photo albums and have fun reflecting on good times from your past. Enjoy being quiet and still. Listen to the ticking of the clock and the wind outside. Measure time by the shadows moving across the room. Give yourself this day of meditation.",Aries
"Apr 19, 2022 - Your positive strength is especially noticeable today. You may find that you're radiating gloriously to the people around you, Aries. This is due to your polite, gentle, and peaceful nature. You're the jewel that isn't always noticed or appreciated as much as it should be. More than likely, you leave it up to others to make the first move. Consider being the instigator today. The world is in your hands.",Aries
"Apr 20, 2022 - This probably isn't a good day to do work that concerns money, Aries. Your mind may not be in the right space. You could make errors that cause problems. If possible, also avoid working on any kind of creative project, since your mind might not be very clear and you probably won't be happy with the results. However, this is a great day for routine work that doesn't require much concentration.",Aries
"Apr 21, 2022 - Research that you've been doing for a particular project may finally be completed, Aries. Now you're ready to finish your work. Your mind is especially sharp right now, so this is a good time to work on any kind of project that involves communication. If you're a writer, your publishing prospects look good. Romance also should be going well. Perhaps you just became aware of a strong psychic bond between you and your beloved. Make the most of it!",Aries
"Apr 22, 2022 - Are you waiting for a love partner to phone you at work, Aries? As much as you want to hear from your friend, you could well get so caught up in your work that you wouldn't hear a marching band go by. As you work, be sure to keep one ear tuned to the real world by looking up or getting up and walking around occasionally. Otherwise, you might sabotage what you want the most today.",Aries
"Apr 23, 2022 - You need rest, Aries. Even though you have a long list of tasks, see if you can leave some for later. All signs indicate that you shouldn't stray too far from home today if you can help it. You're easily distracted, which makes you prone to accidents. Being behind the wheel of a car isn't the place for you right now. Stay home and tackle all those little chores you've been meaning to finish.",Aries
"Apr 24, 2022 - You would make an excellent judge, Aries. You're able to consider all aspects of a situation. This is a bit of a blessing and a curse, because it can make it difficult to come to a decision. Today you could face the challenge of reconsidering past decisions. Once-binding contracts need to be reviewed and new ones created. Prior commitments need reevaluation. This is tiring but necessary if you're to move forward.",Aries
"Apr 25, 2022 - This is a perfect day for falling in love, Aries! You can expect anything to happen today. You could even meet someone who is ready to love, support, and listen to you when you need him or her most. You need to put all your fears and hesitations behind you on a day like today. Besides, a little madness every now and then won't hurt. Throw caution to the wind!",Aries
"Apr 26, 2022 - Just as a watched pot never boils, so, too, do anxiously awaited checks or letters refuse to arrive in the mail, Aries. Beyond double-checking that the person or company has your correct address, there isn't much you can do but continue to wait. Trust that it will arrive shortly, and then your financial difficulties will be behind you.",Aries
"Apr 27, 2022 - Aries, today you could feel the need to work on your finances - pay bills, make deposits, and plan a budget for next month - but your heart won't be in it. Your mind is probably on more interesting projects. If you try to force it, you'll be unable to concentrate, so it could be a waste of time. It won't hurt if you wait a few days. You should be in a more practical space by then.",Aries
"Apr 28, 2022 - A sudden desire to expand your horizons could have you and possibly a romantic partner considering returning to school, Aries, perhaps for an advanced degree. The school you're considering, however, might be located in another state or even a foreign country. Following through with your desire could require some careful planning. As a result, you and your beloved may have some intense conversations over the next few days.",Aries
"Apr 29, 2022 - Some gossip about a friend could reach your ears today, Aries, and it might seem a bit shocking at first. Money could be involved. However, don't accept what you hear at face value. Whoever got the rumor going is apt to be less concerned with the truth than serving a personal agenda. Call your friend and try to learn the facts without prying. They're probably far less dire than the gossip implies.",Aries
"Apr 30, 2022 - There is some probability that you'll want to escape from reality today, Aries. You aren't anxious to face a situation that demands that you commit yourself. Is this because you're afraid that you lack the ability to assume this new responsibility? This is an honest-to-goodness chance to fulfill your dreams of success. There can be no question of evading it! Get busy!",Aries
"Feb 4, 2023 - Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Aries. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues.

It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.",Aries
"May 1, 2022 - How focused you are, Aries! You're so calm and collected. Of course, the mood is especially hospitable to sobriety, reasonableness, and hard work.

If you don't succeed today, you'll have no one to blame but yourself.",Aries
"May 2, 2022 - Take your creativity to a new level, Aries. There are many ways to express yourself creatively, so pick one and follow through. You may have a desire to be on stage, and you want to share your dreams and inner passion with the world. Your strong emotions and dreamy perspective are assets. Don't try to stuff them inside or push them away. Listening to your brain too much could deprive you of the bounty in your heart and imagination.",Aries
"May 3, 2022 - Days like today push you to act in the areas of your life where you may have hesitated before. Does your love life need a breath of fresh air?

It's well within your reach.",Aries
"May 4, 2022 - Some strange and rather gloomy dreams could come your way tonight, Aries. They could, if you let them, catapult you into a rather depressed mood during the day. Writing them down might help exorcise the negative emotions. You could also be a bit depressed over money. This isn't a good day to make investments, start a new business, or open up a savings account. Wait a few days until the planets relax a little.",Aries
"May 5, 2022 - While you may not have been feeling quite your usual self over the past day or two, Aries, today you're likely to be feeling mentally and physically stronger and more focused. You could discuss new ideas for future projects, either personal or business, and formulate plans of action. Your financial future could be on your mind. This is the day to look into ways to ensure it. Enjoy your day.",Aries
"May 6, 2022 - Communication with others should be very effective, Aries, and your social calendar will be full. You're feeling good about yourself, thanks to a boost in confidence that reminds you that you can do anything. You have the ability to juggle many things at once and the physical endurance to keep up a quick pace. Even though you may tend to be rather lazy, you might get a sudden inspiration to join a gym or sports team.",Aries
"May 7, 2022 - When it comes to romance in your life, Aries, there may be a great deal of talk but not enough action. Perhaps you're a terrific flirt who can keep things moving at a quick pace intellectually, but nothing really comes of it when you have to take concrete action and manifest those words in a romantic setting. This is one day when this conflict of interests makes itself known more blatantly than usual.",Aries
"May 8, 2022 - Today your intellectual and expressive abilities should receive a boost from the planets. It's an excellent time to organize your thoughts about presenting a project to a possible collaborator, engage in trade, or write. In terms of your private life, it's also a good time to examine the latest events, certain aspects of which are still partially misunderstood.",Aries
"May 9, 2022 - Some people tend to make mountains out of molehills. Currently, you're likely to feel as though you're surrounded by people who exaggerate problems. You, on the other hand, have a loftier perspective. You're a visionary who can foresee future social trends. This gift would serve you well as a political speechwriter, should you want to take on that sort of job.",Aries
"May 10, 2022 - The moment has come to affirm your individuality and life choices, Aries. The planetary energy will make you work hard to rethink the number of obligations you undertake. Admit it – they've been weighing you down. You can exist comfortably without them, and you can accomplish all that you do with much more effectiveness and enthusiasm if you lighten your load. By all means, liberate yourself!",Aries
"May 11, 2022 - If you give the impression that you're in a reserved and introspective mood (even if you aren't), you'll succeed in avoiding confrontation. Today there is no such thing as a simple exchange with someone, Aries. But even in this atmosphere, it is still a great day to evaluate your fundamental objectives a little more closely.",Aries
"May 12, 2022 - You might be planning to host a social event in your home tonight or perhaps in a few days. It could have you doing a lot of cleaning, rearranging, and beautifying around the house. A friend might drop by to lend a hand. You might also find yourself planning an incredible menu. Don't work too hard, Aries, or you might not have any energy left for your family or guests!",Aries
"May 13, 2022 - Today your brain is supercharged, Aries. If you've been thinking about doing some writing or have put off analyzing a particularly tricky problem, this would be the perfect day to get started. You'll have all the inspiration you could possibly need. And don't worry about shocking the people around you with your directness and assertiveness. They'll appreciate your valuable ideas.",Aries
"May 14, 2022 - Today is the day to rethink all those social values that you take at face value, Aries. Like the rest of us, you learned them at a young age and unthinkingly accepted them. Established concepts of propriety are especially deserving of consideration. After hearing for years about all those things that “just aren't done,"" isn't it refreshing to think that maybe they should be done after all?",Aries
"May 15, 2022 - If you have grievances to voice about your love life, Aries, this is the day to speak up. Indeed, anything less than total honesty won't be tolerated today. You can expect to confront the “other,"" whether mate, friend, or family member, on the basis of truth and righteousness. Know that you'll command their attention! But be careful that the weight of your words doesn't surpass that of your thoughts.",Aries
"May 16, 2022 - You might need to hold your tongue today, Aries. People's feelings are more easily hurt now, and the slightest criticism could be misinterpreted as a terrible insult. When in doubt, keep your mouth shut. Turn your attention inward and focus on your emotions. Try to keep your mental chatter to a minimum and concentrate more on how you feel rather than on what you think.",Aries
"May 17, 2022 - You may have felt somewhat frustrated in your initiatives over the past few days, Aries.

"May 18, 2022 - Has it been difficult these past few days to communicate with those close to you? Are you a little skeptical about your charm?

You have a natural gift for diplomacy, and your sense of refinement will once again be noticed and appreciated.",Aries
"May 19, 2022 - Restriction might weigh heavily on you today, Aries. Perhaps you're being reminded that there are some important details that you need to take care of.

This is an important time in which you can hit it big.",Aries
"May 20, 2022 - Remember that it's OK to have a little downtime, Aries. Don't feel like you have to always be up and on stage. Take some time to be mellow and quiet.

"May 22, 2022 - You may want to keep your ship on an even keel today, Aries, but remember that no matter how hard as you try, this simply might not be possible. The wind is blowing pretty hard and you might just have to trim your sails and go full speed ahead. You'll move much more quickly, but it will also mean that you'll be more prone to capsizing. Live on the edge.",Aries
"May 23, 2022 - Two different sides could be tugging at you, Aries. It may be that neither one is really making a strong case for pulling you one way or the other. Realize that adjustments may have to be made in order for you to fit in the scheme of things and fulfill your responsibilities. A close loved one may be distracting you in subtle ways. Try not to get too sidetracked if you can help it.",Aries
"May 24, 2022 - You may have gotten a financial boost lately in the form of some sort of raise or reward, Aries.

"May 25, 2022 - Focus on the simple pleasures today, Aries. Don't feel like you have to search in far-off lands or engage in expensive recreational activities to find happiness and peace.

Realize that beauty resides all around you, not just in stores full of expensive objects.",Aries
"May 26, 2022 - Things that have been out of whack in your life should begin to come back into balance, Aries.

"May 27, 2022 - You may feel as if you're sinking into an emotional vortex, Aries. Be careful about assuming that things are yours when they aren't really.

"May 30, 2022 - You may find yourself taking the high road today, Aries. Maybe you're even further aloft than that, like a bird soaring above the landscape.

Consider keeping your feet on the ground with your friend.",Aries
"May 31, 2022 - Explore your innovative, irrational side today, Aries. Go deep.

"Jun 3, 2022 - Today you might be feeling particularly warm and loving toward a romantic partner, and the feeling is likely reciprocated. You could have trouble reaching each other, Aries.

"Jun 4, 2022 - Emotional matters could hit the fan today at a (virtual) group meeting of some kind.

Don't sacrifice your own peace of mind just to keep from rocking the boat. Contributing unhealthy lies to maintain a healthy facade doesn't do anyone any good. Be totally honest with yourself, your feelings, and the people around you.",Aries
"Jul 5, 2022 - Let yourself go into high creative mode and drift into a whole other world, Aries. Escape your present reality and explore your fantasies through any sort of artistic endeavor. Dream as big as your mind allows. There's no limit to the things that can manifest on a day like today. Push your limits and test your boundaries. You may be able to soar much higher than you think.",Aries
"Jul 6, 2022 - Today is a terrific day for you, Aries. You'll find that you can get quite a bit done using your quick mind and sharp wit. Information is flying fast and furious. Grab hold of what resonates with you and discard what doesn't. The more informed you are, the better equipped you'll be to handle the decisions of the day. Make sure you have all the facts before you proceed.",Aries
"Jul 7, 2022 - Today you'll find that you're the missing puzzle piece that people need in every situation, Aries. Engage in light conversation in social arenas and feel free to turn your charm up full blast. You have the ability to make favorable impressions on just about everyone, so get the day off on the right foot. Get out of bed earlier than normal and get your blood pumping with a brisk walk or workout.",Aries
"Jul 8, 2022 - Try not to be smothering today, Aries. You may want to seek comfort in conversations with others but find that this only produces grouchiness on the part of all involved. Curb your tendency to find fault in loved ones. Your best bet is to focus your energy on tasks you've had on the back burner for some time. Tackle projects that need special attention and the most discipline.",Aries
"Jul 9, 2022 - You have an incredibly strong influence on others just by virtue of the fact of your fun-loving, peaceful, and harmonious nature, Aries. Your natural charm will take you any place you want to go today, so feel free to use it at will. Accentuate the positive and make sure you're walking on the sunny side of the street. Whistle as you walk down the sidewalk and get out into the light.",Aries
"Jul 10, 2022 - Today you might feel especially artistic, particularly regarding the visual arts. A lot of exalted ideas could come your way, Aries, perhaps inspired by the masters of the past. This is a great day to pay attention to music and art. Friends who share your interest might want to explore these things with you, if possible. Take time to write down your thoughts since you'll want to remember them. Enjoy!",Aries
"Jul 11, 2022 - You may get pushed around by two very powerful camps today, Aries. Since you're the kind, diplomatic, and sensitive one, you make the perfect target for more abrasive and opinionated people. You may want to side with the cold, hard facts presented to you, although there's a great deal of emotional power stirring the pot. Things may not be as clear as they seem at first glance.",Aries
"Jul 12, 2022 - Try to seek freedom and new experiences today, Aries. This is an important time for you to spread your wings and explore. Keep in mind that something or someone may be working to restrain you emotionally. An opposing force is promoting war while you insist on keeping things peaceful. Perhaps there's an important lesson you need to learn. Be more assertive in your actions, and don't let people walk all over you.",Aries
"Jul 13, 2022 - Today you might decide to participate in activities involving children, Aries. Field trips either for pleasure or educational purposes may take place, if possible, and you could enjoy it as much as the kids. Letters and phone calls could bring good news from far away, which you'll almost certainly want to pass on to others. Tonight, curl up with the latest mystery. Intrigue should be especially appealing now.",Aries
"Jul 14, 2022 - You should be happier than usual with what you see in the mirror, Aries, because your inner beauty is more visible than usual. You could also feel especially sociable. Both old friends and new should find your company especially congenial. Romance blossoms, although there's a slight tendency today to see partners through rose-colored glasses. Hang onto your common sense, but not too tightly. Days like this don't come around that often!",Aries
"Jul 15, 2022 - A strong sense of inspiration that seems to come from the higher planes could boost your natural artistic abilities, Aries. No matter how rushed you may be with other tasks, it's important to take time to note your ideas. They're definitely worth pursuing and you'll want to refer to them later. If you're thinking about a friend, give that person a call. He or she might have news for you.",Aries
"Jul 16, 2022 - You certainly are in a strange mood today, Aries. True, things have been going smoothly for the past few days, but be careful not to fool yourself. ""Pride comes before a fall,"" as the expression goes. You should be wary of the way you treat your lover now. You're likely to be dismayed by your sweetie's attitude, yet you're the one who has strayed from reality.",Aries
"Jul 17, 2022 - A long-term friendship could suddenly develop into something more now, Aries. You could see this person in a new light and realize that this is a very attractive human being. It might come as a shock to you, however, and the idea could take a little time to get used to. Don't ignore it for that reason. Just approach with caution and see where it takes you. Go with the flow!",Aries
"Jul 18, 2022 - Social responsibilities might appear to be hitting you all at once. Everyone you know seems to crave your company. As a naturally polite and socially astute person, you might feel obligated to accept any and all invitations. This isn't a good day to commit yourself. Wait a while until you're feeling a little more balanced, then send out your responses. Commit only to those events you would genuinely enjoy.",Aries
"Jul 19, 2022 - Reclaim control of things that might be holding you back now, Aries. You may find that there's an element of restriction to the day that's keeping you from getting where you want to be. Try the best you can to relax and stabilize your emotions. Interaction with people who are older and wiser is likely to shed some important perspective on things today. Heed advice from those who have been through similar situations.",Aries
"Jul 20, 2022 - Restlessness may plague you throughout the day, Aries, because you could be brimming over with physical energy but have no outlet for it. You might have to stay in and wait for something important, which could prove frustrating. Put on an exercise video and do aerobics while you wait. This isn't a good day to start new projects. Limit your social interactions to exercising with others at the gym.",Aries
"Jul 21, 2022 - You may have that awful feeling that you really need to get down to work yet something seems to stand square in the way of progress. Perhaps you feel like you're at a four-way stop with three other cars. Everyone is anxious to go first. You can't all go at once, yet no one knows whose turn it is. Don't put the pedal to the metal. Instead, ease slowly into the intersection and clearly signal your intentions.",Aries
"Jul 22, 2022 - You could feel like a giant wrecking ball that's anxious to break down existing structures. Perhaps you're upset about a new development in your town, the country's political system, or the power structure within your home. Regardless of the exact reason, you're certain that change needs to happen in order to make progress. Often one must tear down an existing structure before a better one can be built.",Aries
"Jul 23, 2022 - Follow through on your promises today, Aries. You may be generous with your words and advice, but you might fall a bit short when it comes to actually delivering the goods. This is a great time to prove to others that you mean what you say. Do the things that you said you would. You'll be able to accomplish quite a bit as long as you maintain a focused and positive mindset.",Aries
"Jul 24, 2022 - Try not to get too wrapped up in the mental side of things, Aries. Perhaps you're trying to work everything through in your mind. You'll find that there are strong forces outside your own trying their hardest to manipulate your thinking. It might be good to step away from the situation and do more processing with your heart. Go with your instincts rather than rely so much on your thoughts.",Aries
"Jul 25, 2022 - Other people could have some seriously opposing opinions about how things should be done. Be prepared for battle, Aries, because others are likely to have sharp tongues. Compromise is the key to finding solutions that will work for everyone. Realize that the best solution is probably one that neither party has thought of on his or her own. Work together to come up with the best situation for everyone involved.",Aries
"Jul 26, 2022 - Your love life is a kaleidoscope of shapes and colors today, Aries, full of complicated patterns and ever-changing displays of beauty. A new perspective is revealed everywhere you turn, and you learn something new about yourself and the people you're involved with. Remain open to partnership on multiple levels in which you experience different types of commitment with different people. It takes every color to make a complete rainbow.",Aries
"Jul 27, 2022 - Let your artistic nature loose today, Aries. Add a touch of creativity to whatever project, situation, or person you encounter. Let your fantasy world extend to every aspect of your being and keep an open mind for new ideas and methods. Incorporate traditional values into new concepts. The new and the old methods may seem incompatible at first, but it's your challenge to make them work together.",Aries
"Jul 28, 2022 - Many people conduct their lives without really making conscious decisions about their actions. People walk around like they're asleep. Don't fall into this trap, Aries. This is a good day to dust off your thinking cap and take action. Don't let others make decisions for you. Take control of your destiny. To maintain the balance today, it's important that you swing toward the sensitive side of things.",Aries
"Jul 29, 2022 - There's an important lesson to learn today, Aries, so don't shy away from the classroom. It's important to control your attitude now or it's likely to control you. It could be that your ego is a bit too inflated. You may end up turning people away if you aren't aware of how your actions affect them. Or it could be that you need to change your approach.",Aries
"Jul 30, 2022 - Today it's important that you make your own decisions and stick with them, Aries. Much as you prefer to depend on others, your judgment really is best. You'll be paralyzed if you think only of how others will react to your decisions. You do know what is best, and everyone will benefit when you act on your beliefs. This is no time to be wishy-washy. Just do it.",Aries
"Jul 31, 2022 - You're an individual, Aries, but sometimes it's hard for you to suppress your uniqueness in order to get the job done. It may not be you. The problem may be your job. If you're feeling like you don't have enough fun in your life or you aren't using the full potential of your creativity, this might be a good time to make a change - a big change. You're ready to take on new challenges.",Aries
"Aug 1, 2022 - Something or someone could confront you today, Aries. Try not to assume things about the situation before you know all the facts. If a piece of the puzzle is still in question, face the issue right away. Your sensitivity is precious, whether you realize it or not. Small things can slowly eat away at your psyche until they're addressed and dealt with.",Aries
"Aug 2, 2022 - Your love life might be a little fragile, and you'll find that your partner is more sensitive than usual, Aries. A more caring, emotional approach to a situation will help you form a better connection with your partner. Today you'll find that clear boundaries need to be established in order to keep things running smoothly between you and your loved ones.",Aries
"Aug 3, 2022 - Catch the wave of activity that's spinning in your direction today, Aries. You'll find prosperity and good fortune within your reach. Expand your horizons and connect with others intellectually. Hurdles will shrink to nothing as long as you maintain a positive attitude. It will be tremendously easy for you to make great strides in any project you're working on.",Aries
"Aug 4, 2022 - You may feel especially lonely, overworked, and passionate today, Aries, and therefore longing for the company of your romantic partner. But responsibilities involving you both could well be keeping you apart. This could be more than frustrating - it could make you gloomy. Don't let that happen. Concentrate on your work and finish before evening. You'll see your friend then if possible.",Aries
"Aug 5, 2022 - People around you are apt to be touchy, Aries, so be careful how you interact with them. You'll find that they can see beyond any sort of facade and easily detect dissention within the ranks. Be honest about your opinion, regardless of how you think it will be received. This is your best approach to a certain situation, especially since the truth will surface no matter what.",Aries
"Aug 6, 2022 - Mornings aren't usually your best time, Aries. You aren't fully awake until afternoon. Try not to discount the events of this particular morning, however. More than likely, you'll enjoy your best mental clarity sometime before noon. Surprise people with an upbeat attitude and a solution for every problem that comes your way.",Aries
"Aug 7, 2022 - If you're single, Aries, love may come to you completely out of the blue today. The person could be standing behind you in line at the store or sitting nearby you in the park. Wherever you connect, don't be too cautious. Move ahead carefully, but at least get to know something about this person before giving in to insecurity and running the other way.",Aries
"Aug 8, 2022 - Either your lover or a colleague is likely to be irritable today, Aries, which you might find upsetting. Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little, if anything, to do with you or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of the way until your friend gets over it. This isn't a good day to host or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until a better time.",Aries
"Aug 9, 2022 - Miscommunication with someone from far away could lead to bruised egos, heightened emotions, and angry phone calls. It's best not to get drawn into a quarrel, Aries. Try to straighten it all out. Changes in your neighborhood could cause problems with travel, so be prepared for blocked streets and heavy traffic. Walk - it will clear your head and get you where you're going more quickly.",Aries
"Aug 10, 2022 - Today you might complete a difficult project that's important to your career. Acknowledgement of your dedication and hard work could find you more emotionally overwhelmed than makes you comfortable. You may have to make a special effort to control your feelings. You've moved mountains to get where you are, Aries, so it's nice to be recognized. You deserve to celebrate tonight.",Aries
"Aug 11, 2022 - Information that you receive from others and from within your own heart could compel you to participate in some ambitious projects, Aries. They may be work related, connected with a group, or your own. You'll find them interesting, challenging, and gratifying. New opportunities to advance and express yourself could open for you. It's best to move ahead now or they might pass you by.",Aries
"Aug 12, 2022 - Romance should be going beautifully for you today, Aries. Your romantic partner looks especially attractive and probably is in a great mood. You might decide to attend a lecture together or plan a weekend getaway. Communication between you is open, honest, supportive, and loving. Don't let this day pass you by. Make sure you get together, if possible. This could end up being a day to remember.",Aries
"Aug 13, 2022 - Some vast changes in your community could take place, Aries. They're positive, for the most part. Today the news should spread widely, and you could be hearing about it from all sides - local newspapers, neighbors, and conversations on the street. The level of excitement in your neighborhood is likely high, and you could get caught up in it. Be prepared for some surprises.",Aries
"Aug 14, 2022 - You're able to assert yourself with more confidence than usual, Aries. You should have a grounded perspective regarding your emotions. You aren't afraid to speak your mind in a situation where normally you'd only say anything that helps keep the peace. Other people may prefer that you keep things on an even keel, but you aren't working for them. You're working for yourself.",Aries
"Aug 15, 2022 - Enhanced determination could motivate you today, Aries, giving you the zip to plow through your work. Finish projects that have been pending and think about what you want to tackle next. Don't hesitate to do something that feels complicated or big. You'll probably be able to handle anything, and it will feel great when you're done. Making the most of any opportunity. Enjoy your day.",Aries
"Aug 16, 2022 - If you saw something in a craft shop or art studio that you'd like to buy but can't afford, consider making it, Aries. Even if you don't think you're artistic, you could surprise yourself if you try. There are resources for novice crafters. They can give you the needed support and instructions. Don't dismiss your ability. Explore this avenue and see about finding a creative niche.",Aries
"Aug 17, 2022 - Today could bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Aries. Verbal communication is likely to be enhanced. Take advantage of this by talking through any problems or issues with important people in your life. Go to visit or call to work things out. Most importantly, express your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.",Aries
"Aug 18, 2022 - If you feel tired, Aries, you may need to close your eyes and listen to soothing music. You work hard most of the time, so do your body and mind some good and just relax and listen to your favorite music. Even a few minutes will make a difference. You can always use the quiet time to plan if you feel you need to accomplish something.",Aries
"Aug 19, 2022 - Don't fear change, Aries. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have far more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant and lifeless. It wouldn't be long before you grew unsatisfied and bored with the same old thing. Try to see change as an adventure and a gateway to greater happiness and fulfillment. Trust in your versatility, too.",Aries
"Aug 20, 2022 - If there's something you've wanted to take on, Aries, today's the day. There's an increase in your physical and mental strength. Dispose of any insecurity or lack of confidence and take the steps to tackle a project or goal. You have an innate ability to make sound judgments and this is what you need to trust. Take steps to get what you want.",Aries
"Aug 21, 2022 - Recharge today by getting outside and stretching your arms to the sky, Aries. Be proud and courageous. You have the power to turn an unhealthy situation into a positive one, but first you must get rid of all self-doubt. If you don't have confidence in yourself, it will be hard for others to have confidence in you. Make sure you let the world know exactly where you stand.",Aries
"Aug 22, 2022 - There's an extra spark in your eye that people won't be able to ignore. Today's a good day to get your point across, because you'll find people more open and receptive to new things than usual. Speak with confidence and you'll go far. It's important for you to say what you feel. If you don't, others will find reasons to walk all over you.",Aries
"Aug 23, 2022 - Get-togethers with friends or meetings with a small group, if possible, should prove informative and enlightening today, Aries, although some of it may be a bit perplexing. You may have useful information to share, but you'll probably spend as much time listening as talking. Your friends may have happy news. Don't be surprised if day's end finds you more tightly bonded than before. Enjoy!",Aries
"Aug 24, 2022 - Your imagination should be flying high today, Aries. Words, images, melodies, or whatever your artistic media are probably popping into your head faster than you can keep track of them. Write them down, record them, or do whatever you can to remember them or you could very easily forget them. You don't want that to happen. Take time to do this no matter what else is pressing.",Aries
"Aug 25, 2022 - Keeping things in balance today might be tricky, Aries, since your instincts may gravitate toward a loving, fanciful, peaceful situation. There's a harsh, warring force working against this position. Beware of this powerful energy that's self-centered and courageous. Stick with the things you know and don't stoop to another's level if it doesn't sit right with you.",Aries
"Aug 26, 2022 - This is a terrific day for you, Aries, and you'll find that long-term trends are moving in your favor. Your sense of discipline combined with a little bit of luck is setting the stage for you to perform. The audience is waiting anxiously, and you have a great deal of humor, knowledge, and happiness to share. Engage in witty conversation and remember that life is an easy flow.",Aries
"Aug 27, 2022 - Keep your mind open to any and all possibilities today, Aries. It's likely that you'll encounter someone who imparts valuable information. You may not realize right away just how important this information is, but it could have a dramatic impact on your life. Be prepared for anything. This is likely to be a most interesting day.",Aries
"Aug 28, 2022 - This isn't a good day to invest in anything. Don't spend much time working on speculative projects, Aries, and don't put your money into anything but gold, land, or blue-chip stocks and bonds. You probably wouldn't lose everything, but it would be a long time before you saw a profit. Concentrate on what you know is secure now. There will be better days to wheel and deal.",Aries
"Aug 29, 2022 - Someone, perhaps a close friend or partner, could present you with a small gift today, Aries, possibly a book. There might not be any special occasion other than your friend thought you'd enjoy it. This can bring up warm and affectionate feelings. You'll want to spend a considerable amount of time with this person. You may think it's rare to find someone so sensitive and kind.",Aries
"Aug 30, 2022 - You may find that you have a strong will now, Aries. Once you get fired up to go somewhere, there's little chance that anyone can stop you. People may accuse you of being lazy or wanting to take the easy way out, but it's different this time. You should feel fired up and ready to move. The only thing that could get in the way might be someone's oversensitive emotions.",Aries
"Aug 31, 2022 - You're less optimistic and energetic than usual, Aries. Your mind feels sluggish - your whole body does, in fact. You're either coming down with the flu or completely and thoroughly disheartened. This would be a good day to take some time off. Issues from the past may come back to haunt you. Perhaps you should address them once and for all.",Aries
"Sep 1, 2022 - Praise you may receive this morning could make you feel on top of the world, Aries, but try not to let this feeling go to your head. Stay modest despite the lavish praise that may be showered on you. By evening, you won't be able to get by on just talk alone. Actions will speak much louder than words and it's important that you have some sort of plan.",Aries
"Sep 2, 2022 - A couple you've known for a long time could visit you at your home today, Aries. Don't be surprised if they tell you how wonderful the place looks. Conversation should be lively and entertaining, though you should sidestep any discussion of controversial subjects. Debates on such matters could get rather heated. It might be wise to treat your guests to food rather than alcohol!",Aries
"Sep 3, 2022 - Expect to fall in love at first sight today, Aries. Someone new will come on the scene and you'll feel an instant attraction. Whether it turns into anything lasting or not isn't certain, but whatever happens, you'll remember this person for a long time! You may also have a sudden interest in new forms of artistic expression and want to start learning videography or computer graphics.",Aries
"Sep 4, 2022 - The tricky things to balance today are your emotions and sense of duty, Aries. Try not to let the stress of having to complete a task leak into your state of mind. The problem is that your emotions may be running away more quickly than you can handle. Meanwhile, there's a bit of a slowdown when it comes to your sense of duty and responsibility.",Aries
"Sep 5, 2022 - Projects that you've worked on in the past may finally bear fruit today, Aries. Financial benefits and career advancement are strongly indicated, and you be basking in the glow of success. Don't bask too long, however. This is only the beginning! You're on a roll. Throw yourself into new projects you enjoy and you're likely to continue in this fortuitous manner for a while.",Aries
"Sep 6, 2022 - You should be feeling especially romantic and sensual now, Aries, and you might draw admiring glances from those around you - even strangers. Your passion is high, so this is an excellent day to plan a romantic evening. You could also feel especially creative and want to spend your day in some sort of artistic activity. Go to it!",Aries
"Sep 7, 2022 - Seemingly bad news about your financial situation could throw your usually even-keeled nature off kilter. Look into the matter carefully before panicking, Aries. There may have been a computer error or other mistake, or perhaps someone confused you with someone else. Take steps to rectify the blunder. It's a drag, but you'll be relieved to know that all was better than it seemed.",Aries
"Sep 8, 2022 - Unexpected people and events are likely to crop up today just as you're longing for adventure. Feel free to hop aboard a train to an unknown destination, Aries. It's better to regret the things you've done than regret the things you haven't done. Take this to heart as you plan your day. There's no shortage of fun out there - you just need to find it.",Aries
"Sep 9, 2022 - It might feel like your home has turned into Grand Central Station. Lots of family members present, deliveries made and phones ringing, and you may just want to watch TV or read a book. This could lead to some understandable irritation. However, be your usual polite self. If possible, get a family member to screen your callers. You might be frustrated, but you don't want to offend anybody.",Aries
"Sep 10, 2022 - It's time to let go of the past and focus only on the future, Aries. A new person may come into your life who can help you do just that. Communication with close friends and relatives is highlighted, and you may find yourself spending more time on the phone than usual. Enjoy this day as you anticipate your brilliant future!",Aries
"Sep 11, 2022 - You're good at dealing with others, but today you should be especially so. Your intuition is strong and you're likely to instinctively understand others' thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires. You give freely of your experience, knowledge, and understanding. This brings others closer to you, which can work for you on many levels. Virtual social events may bring new friends.",Aries
"Sep 12, 2022 - Finances should be going well, Aries, but your financial affairs aren't something you want to talk about to anyone now. Perhaps you want to make a decision that's yours and not influenced by others. Nonetheless, a close friend or lover is going to find out. Maybe they'll guess or maybe you'll let it slip. Don't panic. This person understands you and won't try to exert undue influence.",Aries
"Sep 13, 2022 - Expect some positive changes in a current partnership, Aries. If this is a business partnership, a new agreement between you shows promise of success and good fortune. If this is a romance, you might be so perfectly compatible that you're considering moving to the next level of commitment. Any new partnership begun today should be promising and bring you whatever you hope to gain.",Aries
"Sep 14, 2022 - Keeping your emotions in balance is going to be the key to a successful day, Aries. Don't get swept away by a fanciful situation that could send your mind spinning. Maintain control at all times. This might be easier said than done. Give yourself a break and avoid excess alcohol or any sort of drug use. It will be hard enough to keep your mind clear without them.",Aries
"Sep 15, 2022 - You might just want to stay on the couch today, Aries. That's fine. Don't get up if you don't want to. You're probably better off sticking close to home and enjoying a good movie tonight. If people ask how you're doing, be honest. Others will be able to see right through you, so don't try to hide your feelings. Today is a good day to say how you really feel.",Aries
"Sep 16, 2022 - You should be in glowing good health today, Aries. You're feeling especially fit, and your appearance likely reflects that. You're looking for healthy activities that also bring you pleasure, such as exercise and proper diet. Find a cookbook full of tasty recipes and use it.

"Sep 17, 2022 - Someone you've never met before who you find exceedingly attractive could pass you today. You might decide to go say hello and discover not only a physical attraction but an intellectual compatibility as well. Your feelings are probably reciprocated! If you're single, this attraction might be worth pursuing. If you're involved, at least you might make a new friend.",Aries
"Sep 18, 2022 - Some fascinating news could come from a friend who's presently out of town, Aries. This might be personal, but it more likely involves new discoveries in a field that interests you both. You'll probably want to do some research of your own, so be prepared to spend time in the library or online over the next few weeks. Keep careful records. You won't want to forget a thing!",Aries
"Sep 19, 2022 - Today is a fantastic day, Aries, so make the most of it. If you're emotionally and mentally prepared to go on a new, exciting life journey, the opportunity will present itself. The energy will be fast and furious. You can work harmoniously with electrical gadgets and new technologies. Break free of the mundane and seek less conventional ways of living.",Aries
"Sep 20, 2022 - An exciting phone call or email could come from a friend who has some great news for you, Aries.

Conversations could bring inspiration your way, and your mind is apt to be going a thousand miles an hour for most of the day. Make the most of it!",Aries
"Sep 21, 2022 - Squabbles may come up between you and a sibling or neighbor, Aries. Your ability to compromise is definitely called for here. If you aren't careful, this could turn into a battle of wills. The minute the disagreement comes up, try to talk it out and turn it into a win/win situation. Otherwise, things may be said that shouldn't be, and feelings could remain hurt for a long time.",Aries
"Sep 22, 2022 - Circumstances are favorable for you if you're contemplating investment in real estate. Any sort of investment looks good for you right now, Aries. Be ready to have an important conversation with a young person today. You may benefit from a significant piece of mail or phone call. Even if you hadn't planned on it, you may want to visit an older friend or relative tonight, if possible.",Aries
"Sep 23, 2022 - Circumstances beyond your control may frustrate your desire to get together with a love partner today, Aries. Work or family obligations could interfere. If your partner has to beg off, don't get upset and start doling out blame. This won't help and could put your friend on the defensive. Plan to meet another day. Absence makes the heart grow fonder!",Aries
"Sep 24, 2022 - A last-minute gift that you've wanted to buy for someone special might elude you today, Aries. You could go to several stores and find the item sold out. This could be disappointing, but don't despair. There are other options. You could order it online or find something else and save this particular item for a birthday. Relax and enjoy your shopping.",Aries
"Sep 25, 2022 - Expect to get some useful financial information today, Aries. You may learn about a new investment, or perhaps you'll get wind of a job opening that's right up your alley. This is a good day to consider an alternate life path. Although there's nothing wrong with the one you're on, it's always good to consider other roads.",Aries
"Sep 26, 2022 - A conversation with a sibling or neighbor could lead to you making a new friend today, Aries, probably someone who works in a creative profession. If you're currently romantically involved, this person could become your best friend. If you're unattached, sparks could fly between you and him or her. You could talk for hours and part unwillingly. Exchange contact information. You'll be glad you did!",Aries
"Sep 27, 2022 - Someone who's been ill and perhaps undergone surgery might phone you today, Aries. You could invite this person to join you for a little virtual social gathering. Several people could be involved. All of them will have some interesting and useful information to offer. Enjoy your day.",Aries
"Sep 28, 2022 - What's happening in your community today that attracts crowds, Aries? A parade? A festival of some kind? Some friends may want you to go with them, but you hesitate for many different reasons. Go if you want to but take necessary precautions. You could meet some interesting people. If you don’t go, find another way to have fun. You deserve it.",Aries
"Sep 29, 2022 - Don't plunge headfirst into work mode, Aries. The cleaning and tidying up can surely wait for another day. Today's energies indicate that talking with friends and family should be your main priority. Consider spending the afternoon doing activities with your kids. Hire a babysitter for the evening. It would do you good to go out with your partner - just the two of you – if possible.",Aries
"Sep 30, 2022 - Expect some positive developments today that impact the whole family, Aries. Perhaps you or your mate will receive word of a significant raise or great job opportunity. Perhaps you meet the one who is right for you, and you know it the instant you lock eyes. Whichever it is, don't let the opportunity pass. If you don't seize it, someone else surely will.",Aries
"Feb 4, 2023 - Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Aries. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues. You might be a bit edgy emotionally and more likely to overreact when other people quarrel or machines break down. It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.",Aries
"Oct 1, 2022 - A powerful bond between you and a romantic partner could have you walking around with your head in the clouds, Aries. Things between you seem to be improving by leaps and bounds. Right now, it all seems just too perfect. Savor every moment of your time together. You will want to remember them when times aren't quite so easy. We all deserve such halcyon days. You and your beloved should definitely make the most of it.",Aries
"Oct 2, 2022 - People are apt to try to hit you square on the head with their ideas and thoughts today, Aries, so be ready for the onslaught of information that may come your way. There's a distinct advantage to listening to the whole spiel before you react with your own facts and emotions. The problem is that you're going to be tempted to argue instead of calmly resolve the matter.",Aries
"Oct 3, 2022 - Quietly step into the background if things aren't going the way you'd like, Aries. Don't try to stick your nose into someone else's business, even if you think you know the right way to proceed. People probably have strong opinions, and they won't be swayed in any direction. The best you can do is take care of yourself. You will probably find that this means you shouldn't be seen or heard.",Aries
"Oct 4, 2022 - Start the day with some vigorous yoga and then some meditation to help clear your mind, Aries. Stretch your body and get the blood flowing through all of your limbs. Once your blood is flowing, your mind will get moving. Before it gets too far into its noisy routine, take the opportunity to maintain a quiet, serene state while you clear out the static and set forth your goals for the day.",Aries
"Oct 5, 2022 - Today you might strategize ways to make a little extra money to prepare to move ahead with your life and ambitions. This might be in conjunction with your significant other or some close friends. Browsing online shops might result in impulse purchases, as gifts or perhaps for yourself. In the evening, plan some time alone with your partner or go on your favorite dating app and look for one if you're single.",Aries
"Oct 6, 2022 - Make your loved one a romantic dinner tonight, Aries. Escort him or her on an imaginary magic-carpet ride to fantastic places that encourage a playful mood and carefree attitude. Consider having a bottle of wine at a playground afterward, if possible. Decorate your house with candles and burn some incense. Create a mood that will calm the nerves and soothe the soul. Your sense of romance is right on target.",Aries
"Oct 7, 2022 - It's one thing to be a friend and it's another to feed someone's ego just to make him or her happy, Aries. Make sure that you aren't telling someone lies just because you know that that is what he or she wants to hear. A true friend is someone who is honest at all times, even if it means that you may temporarily hurt that person's feelings.",Aries
"Oct 8, 2022 - This is one of those days when you will be walking along and all of a sudden hear a street performer playing music. Suddenly your feet start to move and soon you're dancing. You find yourself boogying down the rest of the road. It won't take much to get you grooving. Once you start, it may be hard for you to stop. Go with it!",Aries
"Oct 9, 2022 - You may want to remedy every situation by talking things out or taking some sort of action, Aries. Be careful of making any sudden moves before you really understand what you're feeling. One minute you may be full of exuberance and ready to launch into a new project, but once you start moving forward, you're suddenly feeling insecure. Take this resistance as a sign that maybe this isn't the best time to move forward.",Aries
"Oct 10, 2022 - A rush of creative inspiration could take you temporarily away from your social life today, Aries. At some point you could be working as if there were no tomorrow, perhaps worrying that you will forget it if you don't get it all down now. It's no use telling you to slow down. Be sure to keep sufficient snacks on hand and do take occasional breaks. Work hard and good luck!",Aries
"Oct 11, 2022 - Expanding your mind could be of interest today, Aries. You might decide to plan a trip to a place you've always wanted to visit, if possible. Or you could decide to go back to school for an advanced degree. Either way, you're likely to spend the day considering the idea and doing a lot of research. At some point you will want to get in a workout to rid your system of some of the day's tension.",Aries
"Oct 12, 2022 - Someone close who owes you money might suddenly turn up and repay you, Aries. This might be a surprise, but you will be glad to get it. You may want to blow some of it by taking a friend out to lunch or buying someone a gift. Some beautiful dreams could haunt your sleep tonight, perhaps to the point where you feel frustrated when you wake up. Write them down. They're saying something about you.",Aries
"Oct 13, 2022 - Now that you feel more secure regarding your business and financial situations, Aries, you might be looking for ways to feed your spiritual and metaphysical interests. Your intuitive and psychic abilities should be operating at a very high level, causing you to experience some vivid dreams and visions and receive the insights that come from them. Books and online lectures might prove especially enlightening.",Aries
"Oct 14, 2022 - It seems that your sensitivity is in slight conflict with your actions, Aries. You continue to go through the daily motions and do what you planned on doing, but it seems as though your heart is no longer in it. Don't ask why. It's just that you've been working hard and thinking hard lately. You've reached your limit and it's time to rest.",Aries
"Oct 15, 2022 - Some exciting career developments could have you flying high today, Aries. Perhaps you've just reached a long-term goal or managed to get a break that tells you that your goals are now within reach. Whichever it is, you're likely to be on the receiving end of some congratulations, perhaps from unexpected people. More income could also be in the offing. Whatever it is, you've earned it!",Aries
"Oct 16, 2022 - You may be able to zip through chores like lightning today, Aries. There's an added swiftness to your step that helps in every one of your endeavors. You might want to engage in just about every activity except work. This is completely understandable. You will feel much better if you get your work done first and then socialize. That plan will produce the best results.",Aries
"Oct 17, 2022 - Your head should be quite clear today, Aries, and your witty comments will be met with appreciation and laughter. Your smile will delight everyone you encounter. Don't be afraid to let your feelings out to those who need to hear them. Focus your energy on the ones you love. Your heart is warm and generous, so share it with other people today.",Aries
"Oct 18, 2022 - Your mood should be quite good today, Aries, although there may be some strong forces at work trying to subvert this positive attitude. Try not to let other people's disagreements bring you down. Take the high ground and you will certainly prevail. A peaceful nature is extremely important in order to balance the anger and hostility that's present all around. Be the one to promote this harmony.",Aries
"Oct 19, 2022 - Your balancing powers will be put to the test today when your desire to fight conflicts with your need to plan, Aries. You might be even more indecisive than usual as a result of this internal tension. Be aware of time and the restrictions that it puts on you. Devise a plan that uses your energy in the most efficient way possible. It's especially important for you to think before you act.",Aries
"Oct 20, 2022 - Your rock-star attitude may be getting a bit old now, Aries. People aren't going to continue to listen to your demands for attention. Every person in the world is special, so try not to act as if you're the only one who is. Help a child assemble a new toy today or help a friend pick out a new shirt. Do something for others instead of always expecting things for yourself.",Aries
"Oct 21, 2022 - You could be the one everyone runs to for advice today, Aries. You're the one with all the answers who can easily pull the rabbit out of a hat. Trust your judgment and intellectual know-how. Feel free to push yourself to the limit. If you go too far, you can always take a step back. If you never drive all the way to the boundaries, you will never know how far you can go.",Aries
"Oct 22, 2022 - A number of deliveries, service people, emails, or phone calls might keep you jumping today, Aries, right when you're in the mood for a quiet day. It may take all your effort to keep your cool. Try to get a family member to intercede for you with some of these people or you might lose your temper. In the evening, watch a movie and relax.",Aries
"Oct 23, 2022 - You may need someone's help or advice today, Aries. Don't be afraid to ask for it. You tend to be proud of your ingenuity and independence. Most of the time others are the ones reaching out to you. You do have the right to ask for help. It isn't a sign of weakness. Knowing when to ask for help is a strength. Think about it.",Aries
"Oct 24, 2022 - Some close friends could turn you on to a new interest or perhaps a group you might want to join. Intellectual stimulation through those closest to you could open the way to new plans and innovations. You might want to try combining artistic interests with technology, Aries, perhaps expanding your knowledge of photography, computer graphics, or filmmaking. Success and good fortune through such activities are strongly indicated.",Aries
"Oct 25, 2022 - Today your job or another activity could require your artistic skills for a particular project, Aries. You may not be used to this, so it could throw you into a bit of a panic. There should be others around who can collaborate with you, so you will be all right. A tendency to be overly emotional could interfere with just about anything you try. Stay centered.",Aries
"Oct 26, 2022 - Today you might attend a small party or group event with some friends, if possible, and become separated from them. Don't panic, Aries. You will probably run into them later. You might meet some new friends and hear some news that could interest you. This is a day when cell phones and other handheld devices are likely to come in handy. You will want to record or pass on a lot of information.",Aries
"Oct 27, 2022 - Although you're usually very responsible and you try to keep the proper balance between your home and professional lives, today your mind and heart are more focused on your home, Aries. A warm sense of unity with family and close friends could make for a very pleasant day and an even more pleasant evening. Even finishing up paperwork will seem easier than usual. Relax and enjoy a great evening.",Aries
"Oct 28, 2022 - Today you might be in a reflective and meditative mood. You may think about mundane matters, such as how to increase your income, or more complex issues, such as the purpose of life. You aren't likely to want to do much socializing today, Aries. It's probably the perfect day to stay in, relax, and enjoy your own company. Reading could prove especially informative now.",Aries
"Oct 29, 2022 - Things seem to be returning to normal after the hectic pace of late, Aries. Life has slowed down, and the energy is lower but more peaceful. There's also no rush to get anything done. The deadlines can be postponed to another day. You might take whatever spare time you have to just lie back and enjoy the quiet. Don't feel guilty. You can work hard again tomorrow!",Aries
"Oct 30, 2022 - Be careful of being hypocritical, Aries. You may not want to disappoint people you meet, so you end up stretching the truth to suit what they want to hear. You may catch yourself a minute later telling someone else the opposite in order to protect his or her estimation of you. Figure out who you are and stick to it. If other people don't like you, that's their problem not yours.",Aries
"Oct 31, 2022 - People will listen to you much more than usual, Aries. Sometimes when you say something, people hear you but minutes later forget what you said. Today is different. Your words will penetrate more deeply and end up being disseminated much more widely than ever before. Don't be stingy with what you have to say. Give people your full opinion on the situation. Your impact will be significant.",Aries
"Nov 1, 2022 - You may be trying to get to the end of the road too quickly without really enjoying all the steps along the way, Aries. This is especially true when it comes to any sort of artistic project or romantic partnership that you might be involved in at this time. If you aren't savoring every part of your journey, then perhaps this isn't the path you should be on.",Aries
"Nov 2, 2022 - Stay close to home today, Aries. Spending too much time in the car could lead to stress or, in extreme cases, minor accidents. On the job, this could turn out to be one of those days. Avoid office politics and stay out of arguments. Try to sequester yourself and do your work alone. Days like this are best used to take care of your affairs quickly and efficiently.",Aries
"Nov 3, 2022 - For a month you may have had problems communicating with the people close to you, Aries. This is nothing to worry about, yet it might make you feel off balance. This is a great day to settle conflicts from the last month or make your feelings clear to other people. Don't be afraid to play ""truth or dare."" Honesty is the best policy. Dare them to be honest with you.",Aries
"Nov 4, 2022 - Recent aspects have allowed you to affirm yourself at work and, in a more general way, cement some aspects of your personality. Now you will be consolidating things. It's as if you've conceived of a product, created it, and are now finally ready to put it on the market. If this is in fact the case, Aries, the current period corresponds to incoming money - and profits.",Aries
"Nov 5, 2022 - You may miss friends and family who live far away, Aries. Why not make yourself a cup of tea and write some letters? It will help you feel connected in a different way than sending an email or making a call. Remember that you're blessed to have these people in your life even if you don't see them as often as you'd like.",Aries
"Nov 6, 2022 - People and situations that you were counting on may suddenly run into opposition today, Aries. Don't be surprised if the seat you're sitting on is suddenly pulled out from under you. Make sure you have some extra padding, since it could be a rather hard fall. More than likely, however, you will be able to take it in stride.",Aries
"Nov 7, 2022 - It may be that you've been a bit too stubborn lately. You've been doing whatever you want, giving no consideration to financial constraints. Now it's urgent that you take care of any unresolved monetary issues. You definitely have some lessons to learn in the area of fiscal responsibility, Aries! Do what you can to raise your awareness.",Aries
"Nov 8, 2022 - The way you act when you first meet people is typical of Aries. What is it that you do? You try to teach them something. It seems that you always have a lesson to impart, making you prone to giving advice when it isn't always wanted. Try to accept the points of view of others for a change.",Aries
"Nov 9, 2022 - You will feel as though your back is against the wall, Aries. And this particular wall is impeding your progress. Others will ask you questions and ask for your opinion. You may want to tell them the ""truth"" as you understand it, and you could be tempted to do so humorously. Humor isn't your forte right now. You can always try, but for now a sensible approach is the best one.",Aries
"Nov 10, 2022 - This would be an ideal day to think about your personal interests in all areas of your life, Aries. You've surely noticed that in various relationships you tend not to consider yourself and what you get out of it. The configuration of the planets today can help you concentrate on yourself and think about what you give up in return for your need to please others.",Aries
"Nov 11, 2022 - You're the secret jewel, Aries. You're apt to be extremely loving and devoted to those who recognize this in you. There is no reason to shrink back and hide. Put on your royal air and flaunt your stuff. Your peaceful, charming nature shines through, and you radiate the god-like qualities you have within. Whoever shares your company tonight is extremely lucky. Make sure this person is worthy of you.",Aries
"Nov 12, 2022 - You seem to be a specialist at relationships, and you're very sensitive to the ups and downs in your own. But today you may wonder if people love you less than they did before. This is rather an odd question, but another one may be hiding underneath. Do you really have to make such a big effort in order to be loved? Only you can answer that question.",Aries
"Nov 13, 2022 - Your immediate goals and wishes might suddenly appear to come together today, seemingly of their own accord. This might be strange, Aries, and perhaps a bit frightening, but your inner power is especially strong now, and your higher self is manifesting what you've worked long and hard to achieve. At times like this, it's important to remember those who helped you along the way. You will want to acknowledge them as well as yourself.",Aries
"Nov 14, 2022 - Creativity and romance are the words for today, Aries. Artistic or other creative projects are likely to catch the attention of others, perhaps bringing valuable contacts your way. As a result, you're likely to be inspired to move ahead to new ones. You're also likely to feel especially romantic and sexy. If you're currently involved, expect to grow closer to your partner. If you aren't, you might meet someone special.",Aries
"Nov 15, 2022 - Today, Aries, don't be too surprised if you have difficulty getting into a work frame of mind. It's likely that you'd rather daydream than be in the real world. You're susceptible to daydreaming and taking imaginative trips. Consider making a list of everything that you need to do to help you focus. This will help you meet your short-term objectives, and you can take it easy this evening.",Aries
"Nov 16, 2022 - Consider whether or not you're spending enough time with everyone who's special to you, Aries. If more hours are going to work colleagues, friends, or partner, there might be an imbalance that you need to look at. Sit down and create a chart of where your time has gone lately. If one portion is considerably larger than the others, make a point of spending some time with the people represented by the smaller portions.",Aries
"Nov 17, 2022 - There's an advantage to joining people in a social or family situation if possible, Aries. Your role today is to bridge communication gaps. Be aware of details that need doing, but don't feel like you have to do them all yourself. This is a good time to delegate responsibility. Keep track of who is in charge of what or you could end up taking up the slack for a job that someone else is supposed to do.",Aries
"Nov 18, 2022 - Put on your traveling shoes, Aries. Fear of the unknown may have prompted you to postpone certain trips. You claimed you were too busy, but no one really believed this, not even you. If an opportunity to travel presents itself today, don't pass it up. It's silly to avoid life.",Aries
"Nov 19, 2022 - The day ahead may bring a storm of individualism and independence. You usually tolerate the quirks and minor shortcomings of your friends or family members, but today they present real obstacles to your relationships. The only way to remedy the situation is to go on vacation. Spending some time alone will keep you out of trouble.",Aries
"Nov 20, 2022 - There is a possibility that you feel cheated or taken advantage of in some way. Do you feel as if you're paying more than your fair share? The day ahead gives you an opportunity to achieve recognition for your efforts and perhaps redress some grievances. It's odd that despite your tendency to espouse fairness, you feel uncomfortable when the authorities rule in your favor.",Aries
"Nov 21, 2022 - Friends or a group could bring new and exciting information your way, perhaps involving career or educational opportunities. You might explore combining artistic talents with modern technology. Invitations to related social events could follow. Accept as many as you can, Aries. They could make a difference in your personal, professional, and creative lives.",Aries
"Nov 22, 2022 - The planets are moving you into a new cycle, Aries. Soon you will be in a new ""story."" You will have to take stock of what you've learned in previous weeks. Who you are is related to the degree of peace you have in your life and whether or not you've been able to resolve some conflicts. Did you learn your lessons well? Without a doubt, you have a gift for calming tense situations.",Aries
"Nov 23, 2022 - In your attempts to always be the nice, helpful one, Aries, you might find that you're compromising some of your values. Know that balance and harmony are wonderful things, but they aren't always worth the price of self-sacrifice. Don't be someone you aren't just to maintain the peace. Your tolerance is apt to be tested today. Don't feel bad if you suddenly feel like fighting.",Aries
"Nov 24, 2022 - Attendance at some kind of group event might seem especially appealing today. However, Aries, worries about your family might distract you so that you don't benefit from it the way you should. You also might find some of the conversation boring. Despite your lack of enthusiasm, it might be a good idea to get out anyway. Staying home alone could make for a gloomy evening.",Aries
"Nov 25, 2022 - Emotionally, things might get rather tense for you as others tend to demonstrate a selfish attitude, Aries. Selfishness doesn't always have to be considered a negative. Sometimes it's healthy and necessary to take a more self-centered stance. You need to take care of yourself at all times. So, don't try to pick a fight when other people also demonstrate this behavior.",Aries
"Nov 26, 2022 - Have you noticed how delays seem to occur more often, Aries? Today will be no exception. Something you've been waiting for has been delayed yet again. It may be that the order form got lost or that there was some unforeseeable delay in sending it to you. Even with your mild-mannered Aries temperament, you're beginning to be a little irked! Sit tight. All will be resolved shortly.",Aries
"Nov 27, 2022 - There's likely to be some tumult in your emotional life right now, Aries. You may feel a pressing need to have a heart-to-heart talk with your partner. Tension may develop if you become increasingly insistent about your need to do so. Anger or alienation can be avoided if you express your feelings with clarity and compassion.",Aries
"Nov 28, 2022 - Your usual lazy attitude is apt to receive a burst of energy tonight, Aries. It's in your nature not to want to lift a finger, but for some reason you may be compelled to get up and get moving. You will find that when you connect with others, you're more motivated to make things happen for yourself. When you get the attention you feel you deserve, your devotion is strong.",Aries
"Nov 29, 2022 - For goodness' sake, decide today, Aries. The more you flounder about which way to go, the likelier it is that you will miss the boat altogether. You have all the facts you need, so don't delay any longer. Once you make up your mind, be strong and throw all your weight behind it. Your mind can be like a computer filing away information as long as you stay alert.",Aries
"Nov 30, 2022 - It would seem that your sensitivity is in slight conflict with your actions, Aries. You continue to go through the motions and do what you planned to do, but it seems like your heart isn't in it anymore. Don't ask yourself why. It's just that you've worked hard and have been thinking hard lately. You have reached your limit and it's time for you to rest.",Aries
"Feb 4, 2023 - Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Aries. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues. You might be a bit edgy emotionally and more likely to overreact when other people quarrel or machines break down. It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.",Aries
"Dec 1, 2022 - Profligate spending over the past week or two may have you feeling less confident about your money situation today, Aries. Perhaps you've lent some money to a friend and you doubt their ability to repay. Or maybe you fell for a sales pitch that you now regret. Correct the situation if you can. If you can't, simply learn from the experience and put it behind you.",Aries
"Dec 2, 2022 - You may find that others are hostile toward you today, Aries. Try not to take it personally. Realize that there are other people and situations with which you can connect that will help bolster your ego instead of dragging it down. Make deeper connections with your loved one tonight by indulging in some adventure fantasies. Shared experiences will be extremely rewarding at this time.",Aries
"Dec 3, 2022 - Jump on board the fast train and see how far it takes you, Aries. You will be surprised how far you can go with minimal effort. Your grace and polite manners will help you navigate to where you need to be. You're your own ship and there is a large gust of wind filling your sails. Make the most of this energy by shooting for the top and not resting until you get there.",Aries
"Dec 4, 2022 - You may be reluctant to commit to anything major today, Aries. Your natural tendency is to look askance at those who promise grand and wonderful things. You're smart to question such talk. Don't be surprised if someone's new idea garners all the acclaim. Don't buy into it without first hearing the facts. It isn't a good day for you to gamble, either.",Aries
"Dec 5, 2022 - You will be in an excellent mood, Aries, and find your positive attitude amplified as you communicate with more and more people. The one thing to watch out for today is laziness. There may be a great deal of it going around, especially in your camp. Don't waste the good energy of the day sitting around and doing nothing - even though it's quite tempting.",Aries
"Dec 6, 2022 - You're certainly in a strange mood today, Aries. True, things have been going smoothly for the past few days but be careful not to be fooled. Pride goes before a fall, as they say. Today you should be wary of your behavior toward your lover. Your partner's attitude may dismay you, but you're the one who has strayed from reality. Stay away from any trigger points that could explode into an argument.",Aries
"Dec 7, 2022 - Today you can expect to have some disagreements with your partner or friend, Aries. You may overreact. If you do, it's only because the climate of the last few days has made you feel more vulnerable than usual. It's your tendency when faced with tension to be the first to back down. Try not to do it this time. Sometimes self-sacrifice comes at too high a cost.",Aries
"Dec 8, 2022 - Today you might get the feeling that someone in your family is hiding something. The atmosphere might be strained and somewhat tense. Your natural inclination is to try to spread oil on troubled waters to return the situation to normal, Aries, but this isn't likely to be the right course of action here. Let things ride. Whoever is hiding something isn't likely to reveal it.",Aries
"Dec 9, 2022 - You're feeling especially loving, attractive, and romantic, so romance is likely to be on your mind. Romantic novels and movies could seem especially appealing. If you're currently involved, you will probably receive a lot of attention from your mate. If not, expect to receive admiring glances from those around you, including strangers! You could meet a potential date but take care to get to know this person before getting too excited.",Aries
"Dec 10, 2022 - An upsetting dream may disturb your sleep tonight, Aries. Some disturbing information about finances could prove upsetting today. This might involve your personal funds, those of a friend, the funds of an organization you're involved with, or the world economy in general. Don't go crazy before you find out the true facts. The information is probably erroneous.",Aries
"Dec 11, 2022 - Hold on to your hat, Aries, and be ready for some action. You're coming to a critical point in your emotional cycle when your heart feels heavy. You may feel pinned down by a huge weight, like you're being sucked into quicksand. Grab a branch and pull yourself out. Rise above the current situation with the help of a lofty perspective.",Aries
"Dec 12, 2022 - A large weight should lift from your shoulders today, Aries. The air has started to clear, and the winds of communication have started blowing again. Listen closely to the buzz in the air. You can learn a lot by tuning into other people's fantasies. Make sure you keep an open mind and open heart. Discuss your latest achievements. You will have something important to learn.",Aries
"Dec 13, 2022 - You should enjoy a good mood today, Aries, and you will find that things will go well for you in general. Perhaps the only sticky situation that could arise is one that stems from an aggressive approach in the department of love and romance. This impatient urge or petty argument by one or both parties may result in an all-out war. Try to maintain a level head in all situations.",Aries
"Dec 14, 2022 - Take the unconventional approach today, Aries. You're able to gain a great deal and establish a whole new perspective just by opening your lens wider in order to include what you normally shrug off. Your emotions may be on edge, and the slightest thing may set you off on a rampage. Try your best to keep your cool. Emotional stability is the key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",Aries
"Dec 15, 2022 - Communicate your feelings early in the day, because by evening you might feel too restricted to want to communicate with anyone. Use this disciplined, sober tone to get a realistic perspective on the issues at hand. You'll have a stable, practical attitude for dealing with any situation. Take a slow, well-calculated approach in order to overcome whatever hurdle is in your way.",Aries
"Dec 16, 2022 - There's a serious tone to the day, Aries, so take this into account when you get the urge to play a practical joke on a friend. Keep things real. Stick close to home and take care of any menial tasks. Start a garden or buy some plants for your house. You have a disciplined nature that will help you get things done.",Aries
"Dec 17, 2022 - Your emotions may be volatile right now, Aries. There's passion behind your words. You have the power to instigate major changes in your life. If you're wise, you will consider multiple ways to make them. Find the part of you that needs a boost, the area that lacks passion. Jump-start the battery that rules this aspect of your being, and make sure all your cylinders are firing.",Aries
"Dec 18, 2022 - Aries, you tend to run away from confrontation, but today you might not be able to avoid it. Your partner or a family member may be putting pressure on you. It's possible you've already worked out a solution to this problem. Tell your partner what he or she wants to hear so you can do what you want later.",Aries
"Dec 19, 2022 - Think of today as a well-earned rest day, Aries. You're usually the one people turn to when they need consolation. Today, in spite of the tension in the air, your words seem to have no effect. Let other people take care of themselves for a change. You can spend your time quietly reading a good book. It's much more relaxing to get involved in drama that's fictional rather than real.",Aries
"Dec 20, 2022 - Today you may ask yourself if you're satisfied. How is your personal life? Do people live up to your standards or are you always left feeling dissatisfied? It may be time to make some important decisions in your life. What do you really want out of life? You might find some of the answers today.",Aries
"Dec 21, 2022 - Something is urging you to act, Aries. You may feel a restlessness in the air that makes you want to get up and go. The problem is the place you need to go may not be obvious at first. Tender emotions may get in the way of decisive action. Realize that your destination is inside your heart. We all go through moody periods. This could be one for you.",Aries
"Dec 22, 2022 - Your transmission may be stuck in reverse today, Aries. This doesn't mean you can't be productive. You may need to change your approach. Carefully assess a situation before you proceed. Someone may be trying to cross you. Be smart about your rebuttal. Head-on combat isn't the best approach. Try reasoning. You may discover that there are pieces of the puzzle you didn't know about.",Aries
"Dec 23, 2022 - This is bound to turn into a silly day if you let it, Aries. Your best bet is to give in to the strange patterns at work. Communication seems blocked at every turn. You can expect technical difficulties like phone malfunctions or computer crashes. You and your mate will speak in two different languages. No one seems able to get a point across. Don't fight it. Just laugh. All will be normal again tomorrow.",Aries
"Dec 24, 2022 - You've been more thoughtful lately and truer to yourself. This is due to your recent introspection. You really can change your life. All it takes is time and commitment. You've made great progress in your development. Continue on this path and you will wind up in a much better place. Keep your eye on the goal, but don't be so focused that you forget to enjoy the journey.",Aries
"Dec 25, 2022 - You may not want to wander far from your bedroom today. That's fine. Take this opportunity to get things done around the house that make you feel like your energy is an important part of the atmosphere. Hang new pictures, read inspiring articles, and laugh at magazine cartoons that inspire your humorous side. Be soft and gentle with your words and actions. Just take it easy!",Aries
"Dec 26, 2022 - Don't expect a reaction from people today even if you tell the funniest jokes. Others are likely to be reserved and uptight. For the most part, the day's forecast calls for conservative skies and a slight chance of grumpiness. The best way to handle this is to engage in activities that require discipline, grounding, and efficiency. Finish your chores and plan fun things for evening.",Aries
"Dec 27, 2022 - If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. This is your maxim for the day, Aries. What have you done lately to improve the way you live your life? Would you consider taking off on some wild adventure without looking back? Today you may meet some people who will make you want to. They're adventurers looking for thrills and chills, with all the risks that come along with them.",Aries
"Dec 28, 2022 - Today you may be overcome by a current of humanist thought, Aries. Your consciousness is traveling, and you probably couldn't care less about the details of the events going on around you. You're freethinking, which is inspired by your spirit of fairness. You may even be in a situation where you have to act as a kind of ""enlightened"" referee, which you will only be too happy to do!",Aries
"Dec 29, 2022 - You may surprise the people around you over the next few days, Aries. You're a responsible person and others can count on you. But just like anybody else, you're sensitive to your desires. You should expect your desires to be so strong today that they may be irresistible. If this is a positive experience, you may need to do some planning in your personal life.",Aries
"Dec 30, 2022 - There's an overwhelming intensity about the day that might make it difficult for you to maintain the peace, Aries. Strong opinions and courageous emotions are clashing in a climactic fashion. You might find yourself in the middle of conflicting forces if you aren't careful. Make sure you take care of yourself and your needs before you try to patch up things for everybody else.",Aries
"Dec 31, 2022 - You may want to escape into your dreams today, Aries. Trying to do something practical may be met with opposition, as the general mood of the day calls for things to be more ethereal and elusive. Connect with your sensitive side and feel free to spend time on artistic projects. You may have to take a more grounded approach when it comes to matters of love.",Aries
"Feb 4, 2023 - Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Taurus, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.",Taurus

"Feb 4, 2022 - It's the perfect day to get up and head outside, Taurus. You’ll likely find yourself feeling positive and energetic, and some fresh air, sunshine, and physical activity may be long overdue. Even if this is a workday for you, make the most of your breaks and lunch hour by walking. This evening may be the opportune time to get together with some friends for coffee or a favorite sporting event.",Taurus
"Feb 5, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you find your mind going a thousand miles a minute today, Taurus. Slowing down will likely elude you and you’ll have to find one means or another to express what's racing around in your head. The aspects today lend much to communication. Perhaps talking over your writing or ideas with someone whose insight you value will do the trick. Even doodling can give you a place to put your thoughts. Explore these activities today.",Taurus
"Feb 6, 2022 - Try to make sure you get some quality time to yourself today, Taurus. Your nature is one that thrives on intense thought, creativity, sexuality, and emotion. Without adequate time alone in a space that’s comfortable for you, you may begin to feel worn out. Such things as irritability or withdrawal can be strong indicators that it's high time you were alone with yourself. Make some plans for this today.",Taurus
"Feb 7, 2022 - You might be feeling a bit more hesitant than usual when it comes to making decisions, Taurus. Even if someone accuses you of being distrustful, it's your sense of caution that saves you a lot of grief. If a person or situation has you feeling skeptical, there is probably a good reason for it. Examine what you need in order to feel comfortable, but not to the extreme that you deny yourself opportunity.",Taurus
"Feb 8, 2022 - It's time to get up and get moving, Taurus. If your job or home life leans toward the sedentary, your health can suffer if you don't engage in some physical activity. Not only is your body affected by a lack of exercise but your mind and emotional disposition can become depleted over time as well. Even a daily walk or playing a sport once a week can make a world of difference. Try something today.",Taurus
"Feb 9, 2022 - Efforts to advance your career that have led to past successes might actually put you in the public eye today. You could find yourself the center of attention, Taurus, perhaps sharing your methods with others or leading a discussion group. An opportunity to write or lecture about your experiences could also be in the offing. Expect compliments from a lot of people, which could boost not only your ego but also your enthusiasm.",Taurus
"Feb 10, 2022 - If you've been striving for success in the field of writing, speaking, or publishing, Taurus, you have the chance for a real breakthrough today. A large sum of money or an opportunity to earn it in one of these fields might come your way, and you'll definitely want to take advantage of it. It may involve legal papers, such as contracts. This definitely boosts your ego, your mood, and your motivation.",Taurus
"Feb 11, 2022 - A goal related to business or finance that is very important to you could require you to pay a lot of attention to paperwork today, Taurus. You're likely to spend most of the day on it since a deadline may be involved. Take care, however, that you don't get so caught up in a quest for perfection that you stress yourself out. Sometimes obsessive attention can sabotage the very aim you're working toward. Stay focused and pace yourself.",Taurus
"Feb 12, 2022 - Things that require restriction and discipline on your part may be causing tension and opposition in your world today, Taurus. The good news is that your mind is clear and you should feel in tune with the people around you. Know your allies and take care of them. Remind others of how much they mean to you. The most important aspects of your life are your friends and family, so treat them with unconditional love.",Taurus
"Feb 13, 2022 - A member of your household is likely to be in a very strange mood today, Taurus. This person has heard some news that is confusing and probably untrue and therefore is wondering what effect this would have on their situation. If he or she discusses it with you, the best advice you could give would be to not panic until there's a chance to check the facts. The truth is probably a lot different from what you've all heard.",Taurus
"Feb 14, 2022 - Someone in the know could come to you today with opportunities for increasing your income, Taurus, perhaps involving investments of time or other resources in new business enterprises. These possibilities are worthy of consideration, yet you need to be particularly businesslike and consider all the ins and outs and pros and cons before committing to anything. One prospect may be just what you want, while another might turn out to be entirely different. Give it some thought!",Taurus
"Feb 15, 2022 - Today some information might come your way that inspires you to come up with some valuable new ideas, Taurus. Your own intuitive faculties are operating at a very high level, and therefore your insights could prove valuable. Make sure you cover every possible contingency. This knowledge could be used to advance your own career and financial interests, so you may want to spend an hour or two writing down your thoughts.",Taurus
"Feb 16, 2022 - Some minor money matters may need to be handled today, Taurus, and you might find this irritating as you probably have other things you'd rather do. The situation could cause some petty friction with family members, but that will pass. However, you'll be able to muster all your innate skills and get the money matters handled, which will leave the rest of the day to do what you want. Hang in there.",Taurus
"Feb 17, 2022 - You could be feeling a bit flush today, Taurus, and therefore you might decide to do a little work on your house. This is more likely to be redecorating than any major repairs, as you’re more into beauty right now than practical matters. Your aesthetic sense is very high, inspired from the higher realms, and therefore decorating decisions you make today are likely to be beautiful. Go to it!",Taurus
"Feb 18, 2022 - Travel may cause more problems than it's worth today, Taurus. You may forget some vital items when packing or there could be too little time to get everything ready. Your plane could be delayed or something valuable lost. Try to short-circuit potential problems. Use a checklist when packing, keep valuables close to you, and take lots of books and CDs in case you have to wait out a delay. In spite of it all, have fun!",Taurus
"Feb 19, 2022 - By nature you’re a master psychologist, Taurus and you don't need to know someone well to accurately assess his or her thoughts and motives. Today this ability goes far beyond psychology and borders on the psychic. People's feelings may jump out at you. Reading newspaper headlines gives you uncanny ideas about the future. You could also experience some intense and vivid dreams. Make a careful record of the symbols in your dreams. You’ll be surprised at what they tell you.",Taurus
"Feb 20, 2022 - Have you been invited to a party that's supposed to take place today? If you think you haven't, Taurus, you'd better check your calendar again. All signs suggest that you could forget a lot of important things right now and one might be a social event, perhaps business related. This might not be one of your best days. Usually you tend to have a memory like an elephant. Just for the time being, keep your calendar handy!",Taurus
"Feb 21, 2022 - Your neighborhood is changing, Taurus, and the change is all for the better. Wonderful new neighbors may have moved in, or perhaps a small gourmet take-out shop has just opened up. It all adds to the sense of warmth and community of your town. You spend a good part of the day among your neighbors, encountering them wherever you go as you run errands in town.",Taurus
"Feb 22, 2022 - “The person who dies with the most toys wins” may well be your philosophy, Taurus. And today you certainly move ahead in the race as you add yet another technological wonder to your home. What is it this time? A scanner, digital camera, DVD player, or all of the above? It's a small indulgence for all the hard work you do. If these things really give you such pleasure, then you deserve to have them.",Taurus
"Feb 23, 2022 - A lack of contact between you and a romantic partner could have you feeling rather depressed today, Taurus. You might be tempted to jump to the erroneous conclusion that your beloved no longer cares about you and that's why your phone isn't ringing. Don't fall into this trap. If you try to be objective, you'll realize that this isn't true. Chances are that your friend was held up in some way and will call as soon as there's an opportunity.",Taurus
"Feb 24, 2022 - There is passion in the air, Taurus, and you’re convinced that you’re the one electrifying the air around you. To be blunt, you can think of little else but sex today. Perhaps it's a result of working too hard for too long and not taking the time to indulge your sensual side. Well, there's no time like the present. Why not invite a certain special someone for a home-cooked meal? Light a candle, open a bottle of wine, and see what happens.",Taurus
"Feb 25, 2022 - You’re likely to be feeling especially sensuous right now, Taurus. You exude a sort of innocent eroticism and draw many admiring glances. You’re feeling alive and passionate, eager to embrace your life and the special people in it. This would be a great day to plan a romantic evening at home. Cook a nice meal, chill some wine, light some candles, and let nature take its course.",Taurus
"Feb 26, 2022 - A family member or other loved one may not be telling you the truth. In this person's defense, he or she likely thinks they're protecting you by shielding you from the truth. This is a time for you to trust your instincts, Taurus. If you're told something that simply doesn't ring true, check the information yourself rather than accept it at face value.",Taurus
"Feb 27, 2022 - Some rather intense work, perhaps involving in-depth research, could take up much of your time today, Taurus. You could spend a lot of time in libraries or on the Internet trying to discern certain facts that you need for a project that could make a big difference in your income. This can be fascinating and exciting, but there is one caution: remember to rest your eyes from time to time. You won't want to give yourself an eyestrain headache.",Taurus
"Feb 28, 2022 - Don't be surprised if a lot of uninvited visitors show up today, Taurus. You could host an impromptu social event as neighbors stop by to bring news of changes in the area. You have energy to spare right now, so you're perfectly able to accommodate your guests. But don't let yourself get overwhelmed. Simply offer whatever refreshments you happen to have on hand and let the party take its course.",Taurus
"Feb 4, 2023 - Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Taurus, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.",Taurus

"Mar 1, 2022 - Unsafe conditions could exist around the house, Taurus, which may result in accidents if they aren't rectified. Some may not be readily apparent, so warn family members to be careful. This isn't a good day to do any heavy work around the home. If you're planning major repairs, it might be a good idea to postpone them. This is, however, a good day for planning such repairs, as you can be especially methodical right now.",Taurus
"Mar 2, 2022 - It might be hard to get to the root of a matter today, Taurus. Instead of getting stressed about it, take a long nap sometime this afternoon. Water your plants and read a book. Escape into some sort of fantasyland that takes you away from your daily life. Dealing with people on their own terms may prove extremely difficult. The other party might not be acting from a point of assuredness. Deal with them later.",Taurus
"Mar 3, 2022 - Upsetting events in the neighborhood might have family members in a funk. This could be something major like construction crews tearing up the streets, or something as minor as a bout of bad weather. No matter, Taurus, it's going to make your lives a bit more difficult for a while, but you'll have to bear with it. In the meantime, try to cheer everyone up by throwing an impromptu party. This always works!",Taurus
"Mar 4, 2022 - One or more exciting new people could come into your life today, perhaps through friends or group activities of some kind. They might actually visit you in your home. Expect to be inspired and motivated by your contact with these people and others, Taurus, and to have a lot of new possibilities for your future running through your head. You might also begin to contemplate a move. Enjoy your day.",Taurus
"Mar 5, 2022 - Look at things from a more philosophical perspective, Taurus, instead of seeing everything from such an intensely emotional one. You may have a constant fear that everyone is out to get you. More than likely, you're blowing small instances out of proportion in your mind. Use your friends as a sounding board for your thoughts. More than likely, you'll understand the situation better by introducing this fresh perspective.",Taurus
"Mar 6, 2022 - Your sixth sense is right on target, Taurus, so trust your instincts today. You're likely to connect with someone in a wonderful partnership that will help you foster the very plan you want to develop now. Stay close to those things that resonate strongly with your morals. The answer is in front of you; you don't have to search too far afield in order to find it.",Taurus
"Mar 7, 2022 - Things could get a bit tense for you, Taurus. One of your first reactions might be to look to your loved ones for support. Unfortunately, you might find that your standbys aren't standing by. In fact, it could seem like they've joined the opposition. You might at first feel like you've been betrayed. In reality, maybe you're fighting for an old cause and it's time to join the opposition, too.",Taurus
"Mar 8, 2022 - You are passionate by nature, Taurus, but the strength of your desires might surprise even you today. You're feeling especially romantic and even sexier than usual. You'll want to spend time alone with your lover. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from others, even strangers. Communication on all levels should be clear and forthright. Enjoy a great evening!",Taurus
"Mar 9, 2022 - This is an intense day for you during which the disharmony in different realms of your life crops up and spurs you on to action, Taurus. Others may be ridiculously stubborn today, causing tension and frustration wherever you turn. Fun is the key to balancing out the equation. A jovial frame of mind and playful attitude will help remedy any situation that comes your way. Have a good time today.",Taurus
"Mar 10, 2022 - There is a negative intensity about the day that is only going to get worse if you continue this stubbornness about every issue that comes your way, Taurus. Much of today's activity will focus on ways in which people can break out of their ruts and see things from an entirely different perspective. If you insist on remaining fixed in your ways, you'll only meet resistance.",Taurus
"Mar 11, 2022 - Let today serve as a reminder of the importance of love, Taurus. Don't just think of it as a commodity you fight for and conquer with conniving tricks and strategic dating tactics. Realize that love is evident in how you see the world; it's a seed in you. The more you see love in the people around you, even in the heart of a stranger, the more you'll be blessed with its radiant light.",Taurus
"Mar 12, 2022 - Control is apt to be a big theme for you and the people around you today, Taurus. You'll find such a brutal dispute over who is holding the reins that once someone finally gets a firm hold of them, he or she is apt to take the situation to the extreme. There's an aggressive tone to things that can't easily be ignored. Keep an eye on your associates on a day like this.",Taurus
"Mar 13, 2022 - You should wake up feeling strong and confident, Taurus. Expect to receive some good news today, which will only heighten your mood.

"Mar 14, 2022 - As a person who enjoys being gregarious and outgoing, days like this provide a wonderful outlet for your energy. You might spend a lot of time with your family today, Taurus, but you'll also probably touch base with many others. At some point you might find yourself in the spotlight. You'll feel especially fond of everyone around you and appreciate your good fortune. Enjoy your day.",Taurus
"Mar 15, 2022 - A powerful sense of inspiration could come from within today, Taurus. You might want to write down your thoughts or draw the pictures that pop into your head. However, social obligations, possibly parties or visits, could interfere with putting your ideas on paper. You could also feel especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of others, although you might not like what you're picking up!",Taurus
"Mar 16, 2022 - Be careful about becoming too stubborn today, Taurus. This is one of those days in which you're asked to build a structure in a very windy area. If you insist on using the most rigid materials, you'll find that the structure you build ends up snapping in two. If, however, you construct your building with flexible materials, it will bend in the wind and last far longer.",Taurus
"Mar 17, 2022 - A lot of paperwork involving new plans for your business interests could need immediate attention. Getting it done properly is probably going to require a lot of ingenuity on your part, Taurus, but you'll manage it. Your mind is particularly quick, sharp, and focused today, so you'll be able to accomplish a lot in whatever you try. In the evening, attend a concert, lecture, or other event in your community.",Taurus
"Mar 18, 2022 - You may find yourself emotionally challenged today by a strong force demanding your attention, Taurus. Your hyperawareness to every situation might be driving you a bit crazy. Perhaps you just need to tone things down and relax. Enjoy rather than question the fun-loving energy of the day. The more you simply let loose and explore, the better off you'll be.",Taurus
"Mar 19, 2022 - The special person in your life could be working too hard, causing strain for him or her and frustration for you. Their extra hours at work could interfere with your desire to enjoy quality time together. Your own worries could put a damper on your self-confidence, Taurus. You might be wondering if you're doing everything that needs to be done. It might help to make a list and cross off each task you complete.",Taurus
"Mar 20, 2022 - You might feel that money is flowing out of your bank account all too quickly lately, and this might be a cause of worry for you. You could feel you've spent too much on decorations for your home or on entertaining family and friends. Don't worry! You'll make up for it, and besides, you can't take it with you, you know. Watch your spending, Taurus, but don't turn into a miser.",Taurus
"Mar 21, 2022 - You may attend a party or other group activity this evening, Taurus. However, you and the special someone in your life could well leave it early in order to steal some time for intimate conversation together. You should be looking and feeling great and be especially optimistic about your future and the future of your relationships. The future is looking extremely bright to you today.",Taurus
"Mar 22, 2022 - Kicking ideas around with colleagues today could lead to planning social events and bringing important people together in order to ensure cooperation on ambitious projects. You might find yourself in a number of meetings, Taurus, or spending considerable time on the phone. Your mind is especially business oriented today, so you'll be operating very efficiently. However, remember the niceties. Express polite interest in those around you even if you don't feel it.",Taurus
"Mar 23, 2022 - You could have some paperwork to do today, Taurus, which could make a big difference to your financial future. This could be a contract, settlement, or agreement of some kind. Whatever it is, you may need to seek some assistance before you execute it. The language might be difficult to understand, and some of the clauses might not feel right to you. This can be frustrating, but it's important to do it today.",Taurus
"Mar 24, 2022 - An invitation to a social event could come today, Taurus, and you probably won't want to go. The people involved may not have anything in common with you, and you'll probably feel the event will be tedious and boring. Nonetheless, there may be business factors involved that could have you thinking you should go anyway. How urgent is the business? How important are the contacts? Think about it before you accept or decline.",Taurus
"Mar 25, 2022 - Imagination combines with intellectual abilities to enable you to make some creative changes to your home, Taurus. This could be something minor, such as purchasing plants, or a major project, such as remodeling or redecorating. Whatever you choose to do, you're likely to channel a lot of your energy into it right now in order to produce results that you and the other members of your household can be happy with. Have fun!",Taurus
"Mar 26, 2022 - Passion and romance are in the air, Taurus, so make the most of the great atmosphere! Everyone seems to be in a festive mood. You feel close to others and feel profound gratitude for the loved ones in your life. Consider leaving work early to go home to snuggle up close with your special someone. Be sure to be extra open about sharing your feelings today.",Taurus
"Mar 27, 2022 - Today you could hold a group meeting of some kind in your home, Taurus. The guests will probably include people in such interesting fields as astrology, metaphysics, environmentalism, and the arts. A love partner could also be present. Some fascinating discussions could take place, supplying you with enough food for thought to last for days. By the time everyone leaves, you could feel bonded far more strongly than when the party began. Enjoy!",Taurus
"Mar 28, 2022 - Some down-to-Earth conversations with a love partner could result in advancing the relationship to the next level of commitment, Taurus. The communication should be loving and supportive, but practical matters like money, work, and personal habits could be discussed. You'll probably find that you and your partner are more compatible than you thought. Move ahead, but with caution. Love is the beacon guiding most of us through life.",Taurus
"Mar 29, 2022 - Are you working at home now or perhaps considering it, Taurus? If so, remember that you'll probably enjoy the comfort and freedom it provides. Being in your own territory among your books and pets and wearing your old clothes will feel good. However, in no way will working on your own compromise your work ethic. If anything, you'll get more done than ever. Dig in and go for the gold.",Taurus
"Mar 30, 2022 - Have you been planning to travel, perhaps for business, Taurus? You might receive word that your trip has to be postponed, which could be disappointing. However, bear in mind that this is only a delay, not a denial. All signs are that you'll make that trip, so don't panic. Think of it as more time in which to prepare. You'll want to be thoroughly ready before you go. Enjoy your day.",Taurus
"Mar 31, 2022 - Business success may have come your way, Taurus, but today you could find yourself feeling a little sad and wondering why, since there's no real reason to feel this way. What's going on is probably, first of all, a letdown, since your brain is no longer churning out the endorphins. Second, you may be wondering where you go from here. Only you can decide that. Set a new goal and move on.",Taurus
"Apr 1, 2022 - People are apt to be as stubborn as you in their thinking today, Taurus. This could be a recipe for disaster if you aren't careful. Open the floodgates a bit wider and take in more of the opinions of others. Don't automatically assume that other people have to conform to your viewpoint to resolve an issue. More than likely, there needs to be some give and take from all involved.",Taurus
"Apr 2, 2022 - Be careful about shutting yourself off from the rest of the world, Taurus. You might hesitate to talk to people. You could have the feeling that they're unworthy of your time. Perhaps you feel that your problems are more important and that others are too concerned with superficial things to understand the true depth of your nature. Isolating yourself certainly isn't going to remedy the situation. You really need to communicate more.",Taurus
"Apr 3, 2022 - Nurture your loved ones, Taurus. Tonight feel free to escape into a fantasy world with the object of your desire. Make plans to set your wildest fantasy into motion. Let your imagination lead the way. You'll never get where you want to go until you head in that direction. Have confidence that you can turn your dreams into reality. Don't waste another day doing things that don't contribute to your long-term plans.",Taurus
"Apr 4, 2022 - How hard you have to work to achieve your purposes, Taurus! It's as though you carry around an overstuffed sandbag and each step requires a huge effort! This would be a good day to identify the source of the trouble. Ask if you aren't sabotaging yourself and letting your subconscious resist the goals you have so deliberately set. You have a deep inner mystery to solve.",Taurus
"Apr 5, 2022 - Are you thinking of switching careers or traveling to the other side of the world, Taurus? Or perhaps you just want to pull a “Greta Garbo” and stay at home alone with the shades drawn tight. A series of small incidents at work is likely to inspire you with the most outlandish of ideas. It might just be that you sense your inner need for a change of scene.",Taurus
"Apr 6, 2022 - A person with whom you work, probably a woman, could leave suddenly without notice or stated reason, Taurus. This could be confusing, and you might find yourself wondering if there are changes within the company that you know nothing about. Try to learn exactly why this person left. If you can't ask him or her directly, discreetly ask someone who might know. It's important, if nothing else, for relieving your anxiety.",Taurus
"Apr 7, 2022 - Some vivid, beautiful dreams or visions could awaken you and make you aware of new opportunities. They could be creative in nature, and you should consider taking advantage of them, Taurus. This revelation could have been there, unnoticed, for a long time. Don't write it off because of the unorthodox way it appeared. Look into it and see where it leads you. Your destiny might lie just around the corner!",Taurus
"Apr 8, 2022 - Today you could have a strong desire to get out and socialize, Taurus. You could well spend a lot of time on the phone trying to reach some friends, but not have much luck with it. If they're busy, a frustrating game of phone tag could result. You might try just dropping by. Even if he or she can't see you right then, you can make arrangements for later.",Taurus
"Apr 9, 2022 - Career and financial goals could seem completely stalled, Taurus, and this could have you depressed, frustrated, and in something of a panic. Don't fall into this trap. This isn't a permanent condition. You'll be back on track in a few days. In the meantime, be good to yourself. Go to your favorite restaurant, buy yourself a present, or spend the afternoon in a bookstore. If nothing else, you'll feel better.",Taurus
"Apr 10, 2022 - You might need to make a lot of phone calls and get through some lingering paperwork today, Taurus. A business partner or friend could be instrumental in helping clear up some loose ends that have been left hanging. Be sure you get any leftover work out of the way, because soon you'll probably be even busier. If you get bored, remember that success lies ahead. Good luck!",Taurus
"Apr 11, 2022 - Happiness reigns in the home as friends and family members gather for a long-awaited reunion, Taurus. Or you could be hosting a gathering of friends and acquaintances interested in the arts or psychic or metaphysical matters. Discussions should be intense but fascinating nonetheless. A young visitor could come up with some unexpected insights and revelations that blow everybody away. Write down whatever impresses you the most. Enjoy your evening.",Taurus
"Apr 12, 2022 - Your mind is like a sponge today, Taurus, eager to absorb all sorts of information. Take care that the information you're absorbing is accurate. There's a high likelihood that the fascinating news you hear is mostly a mix of fantasy and fiction. Go to the source and get the facts before acting on this information. If necessary, do your own research online or in the library.",Taurus
"Apr 13, 2022 - You might wake up today feeling a little grumpy and out of sorts, Taurus. You could aspire to nothing more strenuous than spending the day without any distractions other than a good book. However, by the middle of the day a warm and loving letter or phone call is likely to snap you out of your reclusive mood. You could spend the evening strolling through your community, visiting shops or restaurants. Enjoy!",Taurus
"Apr 14, 2022 - Friends or work colleagues could introduce you to a field of study that captures your interest, Taurus. You're ready for something new in your life, and the lecture series that has been suggested to you could turn out to provide just the stimulation that you need. Your creative juices are flowing and you'll want to make good use of them. Writing, painting, and photography are all good choices for today.",Taurus
"Apr 15, 2022 - This could be a tough day for you emotionally. It might surprise you to find that some very old, deep-seated feelings get churned up in the course of investigating a subject of keen interest to you. It might be difficult to process these feelings. Don't try to intellectualize them too much, Taurus. At the same time, be wary of situations that could trigger an emotional cyclone. Some words can be brutally painful. Try to avoid this at all costs.",Taurus
"Apr 16, 2022 - You might want to make an extra effort to tidy up the house this morning, Taurus. It's likely that you'll have some unexpected guests. Some neighbors could drop by unannounced, or an old friend could call from her car and say she's on her way over. Take it all in stride. Even though you had a lot planned for the day, it will be much more enjoyable if you spend it socializing with friends.",Taurus
"Apr 17, 2022 - Today is likely to be another busy one for you, Taurus. You might have a volunteer activity in the morning and then get roped into running errands in the afternoon. It will be busy bordering on hectic, but the hustle and bustle of being out and about is energizing for you. Invite some friends to join you for dinner in the evening to cap off this high-energy day.",Taurus
"Apr 18, 2022 - Don't be surprised if neighbors come to your door asking for a favor – and not just to borrow a cup of sugar! While your initial response will be to say yes (it's your nature, after all), think twice. This ""favor"" could involve a major time commitment. Is this what you want to do? You can put your needs ahead of your friends' and still be a good neighbor. Don't worry, they'll understand.",Taurus
"Apr 19, 2022 - Taurus, instead of digging deep into the barrel looking only for the misshapen, bruised, and rotten apples, concentrate on bringing up the shiny, bright red ones. This way you'll bring laughter and smiles to the company around you rather than miserable frowns. Whatever you bring to the surface will be distributed far and wide, so make sure you reach for the good times instead of the sour ones.",Taurus
"Apr 20, 2022 - A lost object could have all the members of your household going through every room trying to find it, Taurus - probably without success. Visitors could pitch in as well and help with the search. The item is probably in a fairly large room that everybody uses, probably among other objects. If no one locates it, however, let it go for now. It could reappear later as if by magic.",Taurus
"Apr 21, 2022 - Dreams and visions about your family paint a rosy picture of your future, Taurus. These dreams could well be prophetic, but don't jump to that conclusion without first analyzing the symbols and discerning what your dreams are trying to tell you. There could be something that you need to consider before you can move ahead toward the future you want to create. But remember that dreams can be interpreted in more than one way!",Taurus
"Apr 22, 2022 - Your sensuality is tempered today with a touch of the mystical sort of romantic feeling found in fairy tales, Taurus. This might be unusual for you, but your current partner is going to love it! If you're single, you're likely to attract a lot of attention and possibly meet someone new and exciting. Take care that you make the effort to see the real person and not just a romantic image. Good luck!",Taurus
"Apr 23, 2022 - You're on your own when it comes to financial matters, Taurus. This may not be what you want to hear, but it's how things are. Trust that your business acumen will pull you through. Don't take anything at face value. Pay attention, write down the information, but make no commitments and sign no contracts. The environment isn't right for any deals. If a deal is valid today, it will still be valid tomorrow.",Taurus
"Apr 24, 2022 - Just because one person is no longer a part of your life doesn't mean that all people are unreliable. People change, as do situations. It's possible that this person was no longer a healthy influence on you, in which case the departure is for the best. You're going to have to become more adaptable, Taurus, because there are more changes on the horizon, especially where your career is concerned.",Taurus
"Apr 25, 2022 - Today, Taurus, you'll really be in the limelight. This could help you change what is sometimes a very negative image you have of yourself. You have a certain kind of energy and magnetism about you - it's about time someone noticed! It's only natural that you should be proud of yourself, and that other people should acknowledge your hard work and effort. Revel in this moment of glory!",Taurus
"Apr 26, 2022 - No doubt you're feeling attractive and passionate today, Taurus. Don't be surprised if a former lover gets in touch with you to try and rekindle the old flame. The attention is flattering, to be sure, but you're unlikely to have any desire to pursue the relationship. You're happy with what you have right now. And as they say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""",Taurus
"Apr 27, 2022 - Usually, Taurus, you have pretty good powers of focus and concentration. However, today you might find that these powers are flagging. Working could be difficult, and you could even find yourself dwelling on disappointments from your past. You might want to stop and try to figure out why these memories are coming up now. Releasing them could reset your concentration back to normal.",Taurus
"Apr 28, 2022 - Some new ideas for expanding your horizons on some level could come to you today through an unexpected source, Taurus, possibly even dreams or visions. If an idea does come through a dream or flash of insight, don't write it off as crazy. It probably warrants some careful consideration, if nothing else. Some research is definitely called for, and possibly consulting with people in the know. Think about it!",Taurus
"Apr 29, 2022 - Today you might find yourself the center of attention, Taurus. Friends could ask for some information they know you have. It might involve telling a story or giving practical advice. Whatever it is, you might find it difficult to explain without going into some pretty heavy detail. You can do it! Talk slowly and let what you have to say unfold on its own. Your audience will probably be rapt.",Taurus
"Apr 30, 2022 - You face a day of some conflict, Taurus. Nevertheless, the discord will prove quite useful. This is probably one of the best opportunities in recent weeks to become aware of some family matters. These matters may have been occurring behind your back for some time now. News about a bit of past personal history could surprise you, and perhaps even upset you for a short time.",Taurus
"Feb 4, 2023 - Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Taurus, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.",Taurus
"May 1, 2022 - Today, Taurus, you can at last express the secrets that have been troubling you. You may be seething with anger inside and afraid to let it show for fear it may explode on contact. Or you may be steaming with a concealed passion for some lucky special someone. The head will rule the heart today, and your mind will be unclouded by any haze of emotion. Perhaps you should take advantage of it.",Taurus
"May 2, 2022 - Your feelings may deceive you, Taurus, so be careful of getting too wrapped up in your own drama. Perhaps you feel you're getting pushed and pulled in uncomfortable directions. You might tolerate this tension for a while without expressing your feelings about it. This is a dangerous policy because it could give others the impression that it's OK to continue treating you the way they do.",Taurus
"May 3, 2022 - You might have questions about the satisfaction you feel about your personal life, Taurus. It's possible you have more demands than ever. Things seem so urgent to you now. Why not take advantage of this attitude to talk about your deepest desires with your partner? Things will be much clearer. You may just need to express some of your negative emotions. It's important to do this before you begin to resent your partner.",Taurus
"May 4, 2022 - A lack of communication with an unhappy family member could have you feeling a little downhearted, Taurus. You might wonder if you've done something to offend this person. Chances are you haven't. The best way to handle situations like this is to encourage the person to communicate with you. If there's no response, wait a day or so and ask again. The gloomy mood will pass, so don't make yourself crazy over it.",Taurus
"May 5, 2022 - A date with a significant other could bring up discussions about plans for the future, Taurus. Talk could run the gamut of all your concerns, from the practical to the artistic to business to philosophical matters. The overall impact of this might be that it brings the two of you closer together. You might decide to partner on some kind of creative project.",Taurus
"May 6, 2022 - Relating to people may be difficult for you, since you get the feeling that others don't see things as deeply or emotionally as you, Taurus. Perhaps you feel everyone is shallow, making them luckier in one sense yet deprived in another. Try not to focus on others so much. Just concentrate on you. Don't take yourself so seriously. Adopt a more lighthearted approach to life.",Taurus
"May 7, 2022 - Things are coming to a dramatic climax for you in matters of love and romance, Taurus. Perhaps you've been nurturing a relationship. You've put a lot of passion and soul into building a strong connection. This is a time of reckoning in which you take a step back and see what you've gained from it all. Do you have a partner for life or someone who doesn't appreciate you as much as you think they should?",Taurus
"May 8, 2022 - Overall, the forecast for today is fairly good. The aspects seem to favor figuring out the meaning of all that's transpired over the past several weeks. It's an opportunity for you to take a leisurely look at the distance you've covered moving toward your goals. Since it's an auspicious day for social activities, why not get together with friends and discuss the latest events with them?",Taurus
"May 9, 2022 - You're visionary and progressive today, Taurus, despite what people may say about your tendency to be conservative. You could easily come up with an effective way to help people. For some reason, practical problems are easy for you to solve. Don't pay any attention to the idle and ineffective chatter of intellectuals.",Taurus
"May 10, 2022 - Why not go directly to the heart of the problem, Taurus? This could be the question you've been asking yourself concerning a commitment to a cause that's important to you. Even if your life seems too far removed to support this cause, this just might be the time to make the leap. In any case, these kinds of leaps of faith tend to occur during days with this kind of planetary energy.",Taurus
"May 11, 2022 - A challenging day is in store for you, Taurus. If you're part of a group or team or simply among friends, you may feel somewhat ill at ease. Could it be that you instill jealousy in others? There's only one way to find out. Clear the air by saying what needs to be said. State it clearly and directly and you'll eliminate any bad feelings among your group.",Taurus
"May 12, 2022 - Today you might want to spend time visiting friends in your neighborhood, Taurus. Small purchases might be necessary, perhaps new clothes, perhaps objects that improve or add beauty to your home. You might have to squeeze a few errands in between visits. At some point during the day, you can expect a very welcome phone call from a friend you haven't heard from in a long time. Enjoy!",Taurus
"May 13, 2022 - With today's planetary energy, you'll find yourself a little more extraverted than usual, Taurus. You'll finally be able to say what you really think about things. It's an important change for you, and you'll find that expressing your ideas and beliefs is a great help in reaching all your goals in life.",Taurus
"May 14, 2022 - Today is an ideal day to shop for a new wardrobe, Taurus. You may find your usual style either too conventional or uncomfortably trendy. Often when you're out shopping, you'll reject an item you really like for fear that it's too suggestive or old fashioned. Perhaps you should listen to your own judgment for a change instead of being so concerned with what other people might think.",Taurus
"May 15, 2022 - Are you thinking of switching careers, Taurus, or traveling to the other side of the world? Perhaps you just want to pull a “Greta Garbo” and stay home with the shades drawn tight. A series of small incidents you've recently experienced at work is likely to inspire the most outlandish ideas. It must be that you sense your need for a change of scene.",Taurus
"May 16, 2022 - You'll find that you have a much better than usual connection with the people around you, Taurus. Your psychic sense is acute, and you should use this sixth sense to pick up things that other people might miss. Don't let the busy chatter of the day disrupt your connection with deeper thoughts and ideas. People are more malleable today than usual.",Taurus
"May 17, 2022 - It will be a stimulating day for you, Taurus! You'll feel great and have no trouble channeling all your energy into your activities. But don't be surprised if you encounter some resistance. As creative as your ideas are, they may not suit everyone. In fact, you could be confronted with some rebelliousness. Be persuasive and you'll get your way today.",Taurus
"May 18, 2022 - It has been fairly easy for you to detect the truth behind the situations you've encountered lately. However, beginning today, your analytical abilities won't be so reliable. The ups and downs of your relationships puzzle you in particular, and no amount of analysis yields a solution. A certain lack of commitment from other people will stir doubt, and you'll begin to wonder if you're truly appreciated and understood.",Taurus
"May 19, 2022 - Try not to worry too much today, Taurus. Take care of details and work to get things accomplished. Check things off your list and you'll feel much better about yourself and the direction you're headed. Keep your eyes open and try not to have tunnel vision on every issue. Give people the benefit of the doubt instead of the third degree. Concentrate on what you need to do.",Taurus
"May 20, 2022 - This is your day to shine, Taurus. Everyone else may be squirming under the prevailing energy of the day, but you should be perfectly equipped to deal with any events that come your way. Despite the intense fluctuations in your general mood, things are on the upswing. You'll find that matters will eventually come around your way. All the hard work you've put in lately is starting to pay off.",Taurus
"May 21, 2022 - If you find your companions a bit too stodgy, today is the day to jostle them out of complacency. You may enjoy experimenting with a bit of naughtiness. For example, how will the people around you react if you flout certain social taboos, such as talking openly about sex? Since you're comfortable with the subject, why not have fun stretching the limits of convention?",Taurus
"May 22, 2022 - This is your day to shine in many respects, Taurus. The action you take is right on target, so draw back your arrow as far as you can before letting it fly. There is a quiet strength to your being that comes out occasionally. When it does, people will note it for miles around. Today gives you the opportunity to display your incredible strength and passion to the world. Don't hold back.",Taurus
"May 23, 2022 - Tension may be a bit high in just about everyone and everything you encounter today, Taurus. Some will feel a strong need for stability and discipline. Others may be calling for fun and carefree frivolity. You could be caught in the middle. The worst thing is that no side, including your own, is going to want to compromise. Try not to take things too seriously.",Taurus
"May 24, 2022 - You're almost certainly in a phase of psychological transformation, Taurus, and there have recently been major changes in your circle of friends and associates. Today provides an opportunity to assess just where you are and how far you've come. For instance, you could be introduced to a new team that compels you to display your talents. For an extrovert like you, this is right up your alley.",Taurus
"May 25, 2022 - Focus on your creative mind, Taurus. This is a very fertile time for planting hearty seeds that will be sure to grow up healthy and strong. You have the ability to be very prosperous, but it certainly won't come easily. The key for you is to maintain your cool. Don't overreact to the little annoyances that come your way. You're above petty squabbles, so don't waste your time on them.",Taurus
"May 26, 2022 - The tide will start to ebb today just after it reaches its highest point. There is a pause now, Taurus, and you'll find that things are about to pick up considerably again.

"May 27, 2022 - Your thinking is quite clear, Taurus, and you'll find that your emotions support your mental processes. Your psychic nature is also strong, so you should trust any hunch you have. The masculine and feminine sides of your being are working together harmoniously to balance out the degree of give versus take in your world. The key at the moment is to not take on as your own other people's problems.",Taurus
"May 28, 2022 - You mustn't expect any enormous changes today, Taurus. However, the process you began three or four years ago will accelerate slightly. You're changing the moorings of your identity, the ideas that make you sure of who you are. Your family, background, and education no longer count as much as your spiritual foundations. Don't be afraid of this shift. Go with it.",Taurus
"May 29, 2022 - Keep yourself open to all the possibilities that the day brings, Taurus. You'll be surprised at the incredible opportunities that come your way when you stop judging people and their actions. This is a time to be humorous and social (from an appropriate distance). Keep things light, and remember to keep a healthy perspective on any situation. Words will go a long way today, so make sure to use them with great care.",Taurus
"May 30, 2022 - Today you'll feel as though your energy has come home, Taurus. Living in lockdown has played into your tendency to hide at home when you aren't feeling 100 percent yourself. While lockdown might still be with us, you're now feeling much better and ready to take on the world. Your emotions are in line with your actions, and that brings great clarity. You know the route you want to take. The path is obvious.",Taurus
"May 31, 2022 - You might want to stay in and not speak to anyone today, Taurus. If you decide to put on your facemask and go out for some exercise, you could run into opposition wherever you turn. Don't see this as negative. Use it as incentive to work harder toward your goals. There are strong forces egging you on, so act confidently. Find a way to release your pent-up emotions, or they'll do you more harm than good.",Taurus
"Jun 1, 2022 - Today you're likely focused on sex, romance, and committed relationships. The planetary energies surrounding love are promising, Taurus. If you're in a relationship, you and your partner could make plans to embark on a new enterprise together, which is likely to succeed.

"Jun 3, 2022 - Ideas for creative, artistic, or service-oriented work might be coming thick and fast, although you could be torn between different possibilities, Taurus.

Even if you don't do exactly what they suggest, the advice might show you new options. Hang in there.",Taurus
"Jun 4, 2022 - Stress might be getting the better of a household member today, Taurus. This person feels emotionally volatile. The least irritation could set off a temper tantrum.

Distance yourself and do your own thing.",Taurus
"Jun 5, 2022 - New circumstances could put you in touch with some interesting and exciting people from distant places. You might discuss business, but not boring shoptalk.

"Jun 6, 2022 - It’s time to get in touch with the people in your neighborhood, Taurus. By reaching out to the people you live near in a jovial and congenial way you build community spirit. You can expect a lot of stimulating conversation once you take the initiative. Valuable business contacts could be made today, although you might not be aware of it at the time.",Taurus
"Jun 7, 2022 - Your business and financial interests definitely get a big boost today, Taurus, perhaps through contacts with friends. Career matters are skyrocketing, and your financial future looks promising. Keep up the good work. Your health is especially strong and vigorous, but your primary interest is likely to be romance, as you should be feeling especially passionate. Schedule an intimate evening with a significant other, if possible, and make the most of it.",Taurus
"Jun 8, 2022 - Today, Taurus, you'll become quite introspective and reflect on your life. You probably heard some discouraging news concerning someone close to you, and it could leave you feeling blue. You'll find that you put a great deal of emotion into this relationship. Don't let this get you down. You need to react. Try to recharge your batteries so you can get your energy back.",Taurus
"Jun 9, 2022 - Your family is encouraging you to reconsider some of your long-term plans, Taurus. In fact, some of your loved ones' needs are changing.

"Jun 11, 2022 - Communication with friends who have traveled widely could have you hankering to make a future visit to a distant place that you've always wanted to experience. At the very least, you'll probably want to take a virtual tour of your city of choice. If you're dreaming of traveling to a foreign country, you may want to take a stab at learning the language. Actually, this is a good time to study a language - your mind is particularly sharp.",Taurus
"Jun 12, 2022 - Family members who live far away might be planning a visit in the future, and you could discuss it at some length today, Taurus. A lot of phone calls or emails could be exchanged.

You will decide once you have more clarity.",Taurus
"Jun 14, 2022 - You're defining new strategies concerning your private life, Taurus. You could be feeling like a completely different person today.

Try to fulfill your needs and forget any preconceived ideas.",Taurus
"Jun 15, 2022 - Today you might receive a phone call from a friend you haven't seen for a while. An intense and emotional conversation could follow, Taurus.

This will enable you to apply good common sense to abstract concepts.",Taurus
"Jun 16, 2022 - Today you might consider entering into a business partnership with a relative or neighbor. This could show promise of success, Taurus, and is definitely worth serious consideration.

Perhaps memories of past partners will come back to haunt you, or maybe a current love interest will look especially sexy now. You're likely to be projecting glamour and sensuality, so don't be surprised if strangers notice you. Plan a romantic encounter for tonight, and dress for the occasion.",Taurus
"Sep 6, 2022 - Strange, passionate stirrings could find you wanting to escape from civilization with a lover, Taurus. This is a great day for it. At least plan a quiet evening at home with your special someone. You might also want to satisfy other sensual cravings, such as a desire for delicious food, drink, or comfortable chairs or beds. Flow with it. We all need a little self-indulgence now and then!",Taurus
"Sep 7, 2022 - An unpleasant situation could arise. Your first reaction may be to protect those closest to you from the truth. You could be tempted to lie or at least avoid mentioning the situation. Don't give in to the temptation, Taurus. Your desire to shield loved ones is understandable, but it could cause problems. You can't protect people from everything. Most people prefer to know the facts.",Taurus
"Sep 8, 2022 - It's extremely important that you not be too possessive today, especially when it comes to other people, Taurus. You have important relationships with the people around you, and you'll find that in order to maintain them, it's best to let those people live their lives the way they want. Don't think that people belong to you, because they don't.",Taurus
"Sep 9, 2022 - You might have to do a lot of running around when you probably want to stay home. Obligations to friends and family are likely to come up, and even though you're a bit tired you'll want to help out. The best plan for today is to get everything done as quickly as possible and then spend the rest of the day relaxing alone. You can have it both ways!",Taurus
"Sep 10, 2022 - There's definitely a downside to home ownership! Much as you love projects, Taurus, the joy is tempered when the chores never end. While your home is structurally sound, it may need some cosmetic enhancement. Try adding plants and flowers indoors. Outside, a few strategically placed pots can act as attractive focal points. You can make a difference with little effort or expense.",Taurus
"Sep 11, 2022 - You generally are good at sizing up other people and sensing their thoughts and feelings, Taurus, but today that talent is greatly enhanced by increased intuition. You should be feeling especially enthusiastic and optimistic today. Both work and home life are likely to be looking good. Physically, you should be healthy and vigorous, and spiritually you should be strong. Enjoy your day.",Taurus
"Sep 12, 2022 - You're likely to be in a solitary mood today, Taurus, and probably want to spend the evening reading or working on a project of your own. However, it isn't likely to work out that way. Family could drop by or some equipment could go on the blink and require repairs. Some unexpected calls could come your way. Take a deep breath and summon your good manners. You can be alone tomorrow.",Taurus
"Sep 13, 2022 - Have you been working out, following a new dietary program, or both, Taurus? If so, today you could look in the mirror and for the first time see some tangible and positive results. You're probably looking and feeling great. Don't abandon your efforts. You'll want to continue the progress. Keep the energy flowing by going for a run or other workout, then treat yourself to a small indulgence.",Taurus
"Sep 14, 2022 - You may feel like you're running into a brick wall at every turn, Taurus, especially when it comes to emotions. The intensity of the day may have you feeling like you're in a pressure cooker. Try not to blow things out of proportion. Realize that much of the drama is more a figment of your imagination than reality. Clear away the clouds and get to the heart of the matter.",Taurus
"Sep 15, 2022 - Finally, the world is starting to see it your way, Taurus. Be yourself and don't be squeamish about telling people exactly how it is. Your thinking is clear and focused. Use your penetrating mind to accomplish mental tasks. Your intense nature is powerful, so act wisely. Today may well be one in which other people realize that you really aren't as crazy as they first thought.",Taurus
"Sep 16, 2022 - Love blossoms in close relationships as communication flows freely. You're intuitive by nature, Taurus, but today you feel especially attuned to others' thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires. Don't be surprised if you grow closer to those around you. Children, in particular, should provide warmth and love. If you're artistically inclined, start a new project today.",Taurus
"Sep 17, 2022 - Career and money matters continue to go well for you, Taurus, and probably romance, too. Your life may be the envy of others, but you probably feel there's still something missing. This is a good day to explore metaphysical and spiritual studies. It's a time of transition, and this sort of interest can make things easier for you, especially if those close to you share your interest.",Taurus
"Sep 18, 2022 - Friends who are interested in psychic and metaphysical matters could contact you today, Taurus. You may discuss a lot of fascinating material, which could alter your value system in a subtle but profound way. Don't be surprised if you do more listening than talking on this occasion. It's important to soak in as much as you can. Write it down if you think you'll forget it.",Taurus
"Sep 19, 2022 - You'll be tested today, Taurus, so brace yourself for the unexpected. A large piece of your life is coming into question at this time, and you're being forced to face the music. Is this something that really rings true with your inner being? If it is, you should be able to deal with this challenge. If you're struggling, perhaps you should take this as a sign that you need a major life change.",Taurus
"Sep 20, 2022 - An online group could form today, Taurus, perhaps friends who are involved in the arts or meditation or spiritual studies. This group is likely to be close, probably through mutual interests, so communicating with them this evening should be both intellectually stimulating and emotionally gratifying. What takes place today could also bring healing of some kind, either for you or for someone else.",Taurus
"Sep 21, 2022 - Money matters might cause you a few headaches, Taurus. You could be torn between the desire to put money aside for the future and the impulse to buy something that you've wanted for a long time. There may be a way to have it both ways. Save a little less and try to find a bargain price for your item. Take everything into consideration and work it out before you make yourself crazy.",Taurus
"Sep 22, 2022 - Did you forget to take two aspirin before you fell into bed last night? This morning you may feel in a fog, but it should lift around midday. You could be surprised by some heartening news from a friend or relative regarding a difficult situation that is now being resolved. Enjoy the boost of energy that this good news gives you.",Taurus
"Sep 23, 2022 - Family who mean a lot to you can make your home an even warmer and cozier place, Taurus. You'll probably spend a lot of time fixing it up in order to receive sincere compliments. The only downside might be that your current partner may not be there due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. Enjoy the visit and invite your family to return when your partner is there, if possible.",Taurus
"Sep 24, 2022 - Everything may look wrong to you today, Taurus. The house doesn't look right, the furniture needs adjusting, and you probably aren't happy with the way you look either. Your perfectionism could kick in and you might plunge into action, determined to make it all right. Don't bother! There's probably nothing you can do to make it look right today. Relax. You'll see things differently tomorrow.",Taurus
"Sep 25, 2022 - Expect your romantic relationship to be better than ever today, Taurus. You're communicating well and in touch with one another's feelings. How wonderful to be able to maintain an inspiring, rewarding bond with someone who loves you. There is much to be grateful for. This could be a good time to take your relationship to the next level. Your partner won't mind discussing this.",Taurus
"Sep 26, 2022 - Changes taking place at home could lead to more income, Taurus. Perhaps a new housemate moves in, reducing your housing costs. Or you might even consider moving to a new place, perhaps one that's closer to where family members live or work. Whatever it is, it may not seem like much, but it should make a difference in your financial situation in the long run. Go for it!",Taurus
"Sep 27, 2022 - With the planetary atmosphere today, your sensual nature is in full bloom. If there's a romantic partner nearby, that person should be on guard! There may be a lot of other people around, so a chance to be alone probably won't present itself until this evening. If you don't connect with a potential partner, at least you'll have a good time. Hang in there and be patient!",Taurus
"Sep 28, 2022 - You may be too free with your money right now, Taurus. You're usually careful with it, but the spirit of generosity and abundance is definitely upon you. You're more inclined to be generous with those you care about. After all is said and done, you could panic, but don't. You're good at making money. A little belt tightening later is entirely possible, and it won't hurt you. Follow your heart - within limitations.",Taurus
"Sep 29, 2022 - It's likely that your thoughts are completely turned to work. Much as you should devote your time off to family, you can't help the way you're wired, Taurus. When at home, you may sneak away to check your email. Perhaps you secretly phone your business partner. Your family rolls their eyes, but generally understands and forgives your crazy behavior. Be sure to turn on the extra charm, just in case!",Taurus
"Sep 30, 2022 - You should be feeling especially confident today, Taurus. You've been working especially hard lately, and the recognition you've received goes a long way toward reinforcing your feelings of self-worth. Your life goals suddenly seem more attainable and you'll pursue them with renewed vigor. Your confidence is grounded in reality. You will surely succeed.",Taurus
"Feb 4, 2023 - Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Taurus, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.",Taurus
"Oct 1, 2022 - Taurus, love of all kinds - the love of friends, the affection of family members, romantic love - flourishes in the home today as you hear from a great deal of people, perhaps unexpectedly. One of these people could bring some wonderful news about money. A strong sense of unity should be very apparent, at least to you.",Taurus
"Oct 2, 2022 - Anchor yourself in practical matters before you try to prove your point to others. There's a great deal of primal energy rising within you today and searching for some sort of outlet. Be aware of overextending yourself when it comes to issues of the mind. You may be so anxious to prove your point that you end up losing sight of the reality of the situation.",Taurus
"Oct 3, 2022 - You may have gotten yourself tangled up in a deep mental drama over a series of recent incidents, Taurus. Your mind may be working overtime in order to solve the riddles. It's quite possible that the reality of the situation is that you're simply making a big deal over nothing. Today is one of those days in which you will face the harsh reality that comes as a consequence of your over-the-top thinking.",Taurus
"Oct 4, 2022 - Do something for the community today, Taurus, and really consider how your talents and skills can best be put to work. Consider volunteering at a school or library. Donate blood or help the elderly. Whatever you do, smile knowing that you're making direct contact with friends who need your assistance. Instead of just complaining about the way things are going, take a proactive role in leading the way toward a more philanthropic world.",Taurus
"Oct 5, 2022 - Your naturally passionate nature should be more aroused than usual today. The festive atmosphere around you gives rise to warm, intimate feelings that bring friends and couples closer together, Taurus, so prepare for some good times and excitement in the home tonight, if possible. Optimism and enthusiasm should fill the air. You will feel secure and comfortable yet crackling with ardor. Go for it!",Taurus
"Oct 6, 2022 - When it comes to romantic relationships, Taurus, you might find that you're playing more of a game of hide-and-go-seek than a combined effort toward friendship, trust, and honesty. It could be that you're purposely trying to hide in order to test the stamina of your opponent. You might want to take a new approach now, one that involves an effort toward connecting instead of distancing.",Taurus
"Oct 7, 2022 - It's critical that you not try to gain the love and appreciation of another by controlling their decisions, Taurus. It's time to let the people around you set their own rules and boundaries. Give that special person space to decide what's best, then you can take action accordingly. It may be that you discover things about this person that you probably would never have known if you called all the shots.",Taurus
"Oct 8, 2022 - Don't take things that don't belong to you, Taurus. Your penetrating eyes are apt to spot things that are easily pocketed, even though you know deep down that those things aren't meant for you to keep. Your imagination might try to convince you that it's OK to pull such sneaky maneuvers, and you may be tempted. Don't deceive yourself.",Taurus
"Oct 9, 2022 - Compliments are apt to feel like gold to you, Taurus. There's nothing you need more than love and affection on a day like this. Beware that you may end up as putty in the hands of whoever showers you with flattery. You may also resent this need for attention and not be willing to receive it graciously. This isn't the right attitude. Receive accolades with open arms and offer an equal amount of affection in return.",Taurus
"Oct 10, 2022 - A small impromptu party may take place at your house today when some unexpected but welcome visitors turn up at your door. Follow current protocol. Expect the conversation to alternate between lots of laughs and discussion of some pretty serious subjects. The gathering could continue well into the night if you let it, but don't let it continue past the point of enjoyment. You can always do it again another time.",Taurus
"Oct 11, 2022 - Generally, Taurus, you tend to be interested in what makes everything tick, from the human mind to the workings of the Universe to religion. Today that interest could be piqued by something you read or hear. You might want to delve into a field of interest and learn whatever you can about it. You could have some insights that are as valid as anyone else's, so write them down!",Taurus
"Oct 12, 2022 - Today you should feel especially warm and loving toward everyone close to you, Taurus, particularly a love partner. You may want to spend some time with friends or family, if possible, or schedule a romantic evening with your significant other - or both. If you have paperwork to take care of, this is the day to do it. You're particularly practical and feeling good, so the drudgery won't get you down.",Taurus
"Oct 13, 2022 - Just about every department of life should be going very well for you now, Taurus. Business, finances, and partnerships are likely on their way to success, while personal relationships of all kinds, particularly romantic ones, should also be more rewarding. You might be thinking of expanding your horizons through new enterprises or study. Don't be shy - go for it.",Taurus
"Oct 14, 2022 - You may have been spending or saving too much money, Taurus. It's clear that a rebalancing is in order if you're to find pleasure rather than frustration. It's a curious phenomenon, as though you've lost contact with your body. Yet it's in your body where you will ultimately find your balance. You certainly won't find it in your head!",Taurus
"Oct 15, 2022 - Tonight, you might decide to attend a small group activity of some kind, if possible, perhaps one concerned with philosophical or spiritual matters, Taurus. Everyone who attends is apt to feel very strongly about the subject, so discussions could prove lively and exciting. Your mind could be spinning like a top when you leave, so if you can, walk home so you can clear your head. Write down your thoughts. You will want to remember them.",Taurus
"Oct 16, 2022 - You're likely to go to extremes today on many levels, Taurus. The problem is that you may encounter opposition everywhere you turn. There's an incredible stubbornness to the day that is evident in everyone's mood, especially yours. Keep in mind that if you want cooperation and resolution, you will need to compromise. Try to see other people's needs as well.",Taurus
"Oct 17, 2022 - Don't worry about probing too deeply today, Taurus. Trust people more than you normally would. You will find that things go much more smoothly if you approach them from a neutral or positive and not accusatory position. Listen to the people you care about the most. They're trying to convey important information. You might not want to hear it now, but in the long run, it's in everyone's best interests that you do.",Taurus
"Oct 18, 2022 - Today's arena is one in which you can find a great deal of material, Taurus. There will be no shortage of energy to work with or opinions coming from you. Realize that your words have a greater potency about them as people become more intent on uncovering the truth. Apply yourself to peace and cooperation among groups. Help people work together toward a common goal.",Taurus
"Oct 19, 2022 - Try not to get too frustrated by the indecisiveness that plagues you today, Taurus. The longer you stand still, the harder it will be to get moving. The key is to find a balance between planning and forcefulness. There's an incredible need for you make progress now. If you're met with resistance, you should probably just back off for now. Fighting won't yield positive results now.",Taurus
"Oct 20, 2022 - Your ship is finally coming into port after being out in rough seas for so long, Taurus. It's time to dock the boat for a while. Relax and explore the area. There is nothing wrong with getting off your vessel for a while. You may not even realize how much you've missed solid ground until now. Remember what it's like to be stable again.",Taurus
"Oct 21, 2022 - You may get frustrated when you find that people aren't as sensitive to a situation as you want them to be, Taurus. While you're looking to make a strong connection with someone, almost wanting to take possession of his or her feelings, that person, in turn, is trying to pull back. People are apt to gravitate toward rational facts rather than intense, smothering emotions.",Taurus
"Oct 22, 2022 - A close friend might pass along some seemingly harmless but nonetheless untrue gossip, Taurus. Don't accept anything you hear today until you check the facts for yourself. Any information you receive is likely to be exaggerated if not totally false. You might find a lot of material on subjects that interest you - too much for you to read all at once, although you might wish you could!",Taurus
"Oct 23, 2022 - Is your significant other uncertain about spending much time with you today, Taurus? You may be hurt at first, as your honey could feel obligated to spend some private time with family members. You should be able to get together as you hoped. Just don't expect it to be for the whole day. Spend your alone time relaxing and sprucing yourself up.",Taurus
"Oct 24, 2022 - Sudden, unexpected news could arrive today, perhaps by mail or phone. You could host a virtual group meeting of some kind. A lot of exciting information and stimulating conversation could take place, Taurus, bringing fresh ideas that spark new interests. Expect a very busy but productive day, looking ahead toward the future rather than back toward the past.",Taurus
"Oct 25, 2022 - A subject of interest that you've been pursuing could bring up some deeply buried emotions today, Taurus. You might want to retreat into your mind and try to make sense of it, although analyzing it intellectually may not be the answer. Avoid emotional confrontations. Things might be said that shouldn't be said, and they won't be easily forgotten. In the evening, watch a movie full of special effects.",Taurus
"Oct 26, 2022 - Surprise visitors could result in a small impromptu party of some sort, if possible. This could be fun for you, Taurus, but it could also be a bit irritating. It might interfere with something you had planned. There's nothing you can do without sounding like Scrooge. Go with the flow, enjoy yourself, and then try to salvage your own plans as best as you can.",Taurus
"Oct 27, 2022 - Having a sense of community unites the people around you in aiming for a common goal, and this could be a new interest for you, Taurus. Warm and loving emails and calls could come from family, close friends, or your life partner. An impromptu short trip to a favorite place could result in a pleasant surprise. This promises to be a busy day and a great one.",Taurus
"Oct 28, 2022 - Obligations to friends and groups could interfere with time that you want to spend with your partner. A number of people in your home might demand more of your time, energy, and attention, and you might find this disconcerting. You're no one's servant, Taurus. You're entitled to enjoy yourself. Save some time for your mate at the end of the day.",Taurus
"Oct 29, 2022 - Have you been waiting for a letter or call from a business or romantic partner for a long time, Taurus? If so, you will probably receive it today. Don't be surprised if it's long! News and useful information could be exchanged. You will feel energized and determined once the communication is completed. The partnership's future goals will be more strictly defined as a result.",Taurus
"Oct 30, 2022 - You may find that someone approaches you with harsh words that are apt to have a significant impact on your state of mind. You could even find that you're paralyzed in the sense that you begin to question your current actions or ones you plan to take in the future. Spend some time alone in order to sort things out before you go ahead and make any drastic life-changing moves.",Taurus
"Oct 31, 2022 - You're apt to disagree sharply with information you receive, Taurus. Perhaps your attitude is a bit selfish, so you aren't able to appreciate ideas that are more humanitarian in nature. Expand your way of thinking to include the people around you. You will find that the more you offer yourself to others, the more respected and happier you will be overall.",Taurus
"Nov 1, 2022 - When your heart is gently touched, it feels loving, generous, and supportive of everyone, Taurus. If your heart is lonely, it feels deserted by everyone. It would be impossible to try to make sense of why things need to be so extreme for you, but the fact of the matter is that you don't need to figure it out rationally. You only need to accept that this is how you feel.",Taurus
"Nov 2, 2022 - Money matters might take a turn for the worse today. Don't fly off the handle because of this, Taurus. Use every bit of financial savvy you have to put things straight. Try to remain calm and collected when dealing with stubborn people. Don't be drawn into arguments. You will be able to pull everything together again, but only by your ingenuity. Don't depend on others.",Taurus
"Nov 3, 2022 - Taurus, you tend to live your life vicariously through your partner. Today you may come to the realization that this isn't healthy for you. You may realize that you give more of yourself than you get back, draining you of energy. In fact, you're almost completely out. Be selfish today. You need to do something for you for once, and it's about time!",Taurus
"Nov 4, 2022 - Today's planetary aspects herald the beginning of an especially agreeable period. You will carry confidence, clarity, and positive influence wherever you go, Taurus. You've used up a lot of your reserves recently and made it to this stage just in the nick of time. Enjoy your new strength.",Taurus
"Nov 5, 2022 - You may have recently inherited either some money or some free time. This is a real gift, and if invested wisely, it could lead to some important self-discoveries. Perhaps you could use the money to enroll in college, take music lessons, or do something else that makes your heart soar. If you received free time, you could catch up on reading, paint, or try some writing.",Taurus
"Nov 6, 2022 - Your ego has probably been feeling strong lately, and you may feel an extra boost of self-confidence, Taurus. Don't be surprised if your ego gets threatened by someone who appears out of the blue with an aggressive, opinionated attitude, someone who isn't on quite the same track as you. You may find it hard to deal with people today, since they could be a bit spacey.",Taurus
"Nov 7, 2022 - You may find yourself in a situation where you need to choose whether or not to commit to a relationship, Taurus. Old demons could come back to haunt you, renewing doubts and creating fears about a lack of freedom. Ignore these demons at all costs! If you give in to them, you're likely to lose a lot of ground. Be courageous and decide on your own.",Taurus
"Nov 8, 2022 - Your philosophy of life comes naturally, Taurus. Others need to study, listen to experts, or sign on to various allegiances. You, on the other hand, already have a profound outlook on life that you surely inherited from your past experiences. It would be interesting for you to expand on your philosophy a bit and try to turn it into something concrete.",Taurus
"Nov 9, 2022 - Today is likely to be a bit gray, Taurus. You won't be able to see how you can get out of your current situation. You may have some financial or physical problems at the moment. If this is the case, it's because you don't rely enough on your abilities and good sense to pull you through. It's possible that you don't take care of your body as well as you should. That's easily remedied.",Taurus
"Nov 10, 2022 - Taurus, don't be surprised if you meet people who are quite self-centered today. In general, it could be that you have a hard time understanding people who are egotistical and don't participate in activities with others. Today you could try looking at them as if they had something to teach you - the value of living a bit more for yourself and less for others.",Taurus
"Nov 11, 2022 - You may feel locked in a bind of deep emotion and stubborn attitudes with close friends or lovers, Taurus. Perhaps it's hard for you to say what you really feel. You may be under the impression that you're being tested and judged by everyone else. Try not to let your ego get in the way of a good time. Say what you feel without getting worried about how others will react.",Taurus
"Nov 12, 2022 - You're usually full of energy, Taurus, but today you may not feel so vivacious. There's nothing to worry about. In fact, you may have the time to do some thinking about your personal life and what you expect to get out of your relationships. You might also want to think about how you intend to go about getting it! Perhaps some of your motivations have changed lately.",Taurus
"Nov 13, 2022 - If you've been working toward manifesting extra money in your life, Taurus, you will probably see it happen today.

Among them could be someone very special who might play a positive role in your life. As a result of this gathering you could find inspiration to move ahead with personal projects. In the evening, watch a romantic movie or talk to someone you’re attracted to!",Taurus
"Nov 15, 2022 - You may find today that people are really attracted to you as a friend. This is because you're usually a good listener. You're open to other people's ideas and thoughts and can care easily. Consider noticing those around you to see if there isn't someone who could use an ear to listen to a problem. It may not take a lot to get someone talking.",Taurus
"Nov 16, 2022 - If your partner acts quickly on his or her passions today, Taurus, you will probably want to slow things down a bit. ""Nice and easy"" is the phrase of the day for you, so create an environment that will allow for more time in such circumstances. Let your partner know how you feel and what you'd like to see happen. No one is a mind reader. There's far less chance of any misunderstanding when there is open communication.",Taurus
"Nov 17, 2022 - Calm down and get organized before you spread your ideas to others, Taurus. This is especially true when it comes to love and romance. As soon as this topic comes up, you tense up and erupt inappropriately. Ground yourself and find your center of balance - literally and figuratively - before you proceed. Don't worry about getting the upper hand. What you need to do is join hands.",Taurus
"Nov 18, 2022 - Something is currently compelling you to be more of a world citizen than usual, Taurus. You may find this somewhat disturbing. You feel as though the roots of your identity, such as your family background and social standing, are dissolving little by little. Comfort yourself with the knowledge that your family is simply changing and expanding. It will stabilize again on another, higher plane.",Taurus
"Nov 19, 2022 - If you want to make the best of the day ahead, Taurus, try to convince your team or family to work together. This is tricky to do, what with everyone's schedule being so demanding right now. Hard as it is to coordinate their efforts and orchestrate harmony, the strength of your character and your team spirit will make it all work out.",Taurus
"Nov 20, 2022 - You're gifted at bringing people together, there's no doubt about that, Taurus. Today will be especially good for participating in or initiating group activities. It's a favorable day for any project related to fellowship and assistance. You might do the groundwork to form a team, discussion group, or charitable endeavor.",Taurus
"Nov 21, 2022 - Today you could decide to host a virtual party or small meeting in your home. You miss having a lot of visitors. This should be an exciting occasion, Taurus, and you could go out of your way to make this the best small event possible. It will probably be worth it. This event could bring people and information your way that make a big difference to you.",Taurus
"Nov 22, 2022 - Have you done the cleaning that the planetary configurations asked you to do in recent weeks, Taurus? If this is the case, today you should start to feel less weighed down by the conventions in your life. You've undoubtedly solved some of the problems in your relationships. You will feel as if you're in a kind of renaissance through the next cycle.",Taurus
"Nov 23, 2022 - Actions could be quick and intense today, Taurus. Things may hit you like lightning, so be prepared for just about anything. Mentally stabilize yourself before interacting with others. Dress to demonstrate your power. You're a force to be reckoned with, not one to be stepped on. Violent emotions are apt to emerge. Don't fight the urge to release any anger you feel. Direct it appropriately.",Taurus
"Nov 24, 2022 - Let's face it, Taurus. Today you're likely to find your chores and errands exceedingly boring. You could find yourself watching the clock, feeling like an hour has gone by and then realizing it's only been ten minutes. If you can put off your tasks until tomorrow, by all means do so. Nothing is so urgent that it requires your undivided attention all day. Treat yourself to a fun afternoon.",Taurus
"Nov 25, 2022 - You might be stirred by the energy present in the air today, Taurus. Put on your armor and get ready to do battle. Others may cower when they look out their window and see what's going on outside, but you want to jump into the fray. Strong, aggressive emotions are the weapons of the day, and everybody knows that you have quite an arsenal in this department.",Taurus
"Nov 26, 2022 - Get outside and get moving, Taurus! If you can manage to take the day off, this would be a good time to release some energy. You used to enjoy competition when you were little. Remember how exhilarating it was to be the first to the top of the hill? You will find your life greatly enriched if you could find a way to rekindle similar feelings.",Taurus
"Nov 27, 2022 - Friends and family, while dear, can be irritating today, Taurus. Everyone around you seems upset and unable to communicate clearly. Fortunately, your temper has a long fuse. To avoid a sudden explosion, it would be a good idea to avoid home and the tensions there. If you take a break from your normal routine, you're likely to meet people who will put you in a calmer frame of mind.",Taurus
"Nov 28, 2022 - You may find your emotions difficult to deal with, Taurus, especially later in the day. Consider taking an intellectual instead of emotional approach. Your feelings could send you into a drastic mood swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. The thing you really need right now - especially tonight - is balance. Tie up any loose ends to maintain more equilibrium.",Taurus
"Nov 29, 2022 - Mentally, you're apt to do very well today, Taurus. You will find that you can tackle just about any cerebral challenge that comes along. The most difficult aspect of the day will be dealing with your emotions. More than likely, you will feel a great desire for attention. You just want to be loved. Get up on stage and say what's in your heart. This isn't a good time to harbor your feelings.",Taurus
"Nov 30, 2022 - You may have been spending or saving too much money, Taurus. It's clear that a rebalancing is in order if you're to find pleasure rather than eternal frustration. It's a curious phenomenon. It's as though you have lost contact with your body. Yet it's in your body where you will ultimately find your balance. You certainly won't find it in your head!",Taurus
"Feb 4, 2023 - Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Taurus, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.",Taurus
"Dec 1, 2022 - Your ambition and will to succeed may be at war with your feelings today, Taurus. Perhaps you've been working so hard that you aren't paying enough attention to friends and family - and they miss you. Children and young people may be very much on your mind. Perhaps you doubt your ability to fulfill your responsibilities. Be objective when considering the situation. Don't let your emotions run away with you.",Taurus
"Dec 2, 2022 - Put your incredible sensitivity to work for you today in a way that inspires action, Taurus. There's so much within you that needs expression at this time. Don't hold back any longer. When it comes to issues regarding love and romance, feel free to make a move. You may be attracted to those who tickle your brain cells. Philosophical discussions will be quite rewarding.",Taurus
"Dec 3, 2022 - Flexibility is important today, Taurus. Take the relaxed, laid-back approach. Trying to ram your ideas through isn't the best tactic. Having tunnel vision will restrict you in many ways. Keep an open mind and be receptive to other people's ideas and opinions. You have a great deal of power at your fingertips. It would be a shame to waste it by not having the breadth of vision to see all your options.",Taurus
"Dec 4, 2022 - This may be one of those days when you feel completely alone even if there are hundreds of people around, Taurus. No one seems to understand your perspective. Your incredible sensitivity and emotionalism are putting you in a category all your own. Try not to ostracize yourself from the group. Reach out instead of pulling away. You have more in common with other people than you think.",Taurus
"Dec 5, 2022 - Speak your mind clearly, Taurus. Other people aren't mind readers like you are. If you keep waiting for someone to figure out what you're thinking, it will be a long time before the truth comes out. Give people a break and let them know what's going on inside your head. Communication is important, and today it begins with you. Feel free to take the first step toward opening the door.",Taurus
"Dec 6, 2022 - It will be as though you're in a new and hopeful world today, Taurus. The people you meet will be cordial and caring, and the future will seem like a bright, attractive place to live. In other words, it's like a fabulous dream, and the alarm clock is bound to wake you up soon. True, the glorious feeling won't last long, so take advantage of the day. Reality is sweet at times.",Taurus
"Dec 7, 2022 - Today you will be confrontational, Taurus. This comes after several weeks of holding yourself back from openly criticizing other people. You have especially strong feelings concerning anything that touches activities outside of the family. An explosion is imminent and likely unavoidable. Go ahead and express yourself. You will all be best friends again tomorrow!",Taurus
"Dec 8, 2022 - Gossip you hear today might make you angry. You're likely to sense it isn't true. Take nothing at face value today. Check the facts before making any judgments. Discontent is in the air, Taurus, and when people are disgruntled, they tend to say things they don't mean. Avoid the temptation to be confrontational. It will only make things worse. Try to spend some time alone if you can.",Taurus
"Dec 9, 2022 - An increased level of ESP and imagination could have you feeling more creative and artistic. You might want to channel this energy into writing, painting, or adding touches to your living room. You're likely to be especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of others, particularly family. You could grow closer, especially if you sense what they need even before they do.",Taurus
"Dec 10, 2022 - It could be hard to complete tasks today. A disagreement with other household members might give you the idea that everyone is against you. This isn't so, Taurus. Try to be objective and consider other points of view, and don't turn this into a power struggle. Stay calm, take a deep breath, and try to communicate with the others. The results could prove pleasantly surprising!",Taurus
"Dec 11, 2022 - In a string of intense emotional dramas, the last thing you need is one more, Taurus. Unfortunately, it looks like you're going to get just that. Once again, an incredible romantic scenario is coming to a head, and your emotions are in turmoil. Hold still, wait for the hit, and then proceed. If you have the feeling that you're going to blow up at someone, simply walk away from the situation.",Taurus
"Dec 12, 2022 - People may be abrasive today, Taurus, but you will find after careful assessment that they don't mean any harm. More than likely they aren't fully informed. They're acting on misinformation. There's likely to be a cloudy haze in the air. Everyone will have an opinion on the best way to go about tackling an issue. Rely on your own cunning to cut to the core of the problem.",Taurus
"Dec 13, 2022 - Circumstances of the day may result in some tricky situations for you, Taurus. You could be caught between a rock and a hard place. The instinct to make war or peace with any given issue is making you restless. On the one hand, you may want to smooth things out in a reasonable manner. On the other, there is a part of you that is eager to declare all-out nuclear warfare.",Taurus
"Dec 14, 2022 - Today is a day of opposites for you. You may jump from one thing to another, Taurus. Somehow nothing seems to sit right with you, and so your search intensifies. Try to be the active one in the situation as opposed to the one acted upon. There is the potential for you to get knocked about, but you can easily turn this around by striking the first blow.",Taurus
"Dec 15, 2022 - Things will get much easier and more controlled as the day progresses, Taurus. People's superficial attitudes and idle chatter will give way to more realistic and deep-seated conversations as the evening hours draw near. You will find that it's much easier to get to the heart of the issues and be more honest and realistic about your emotions tonight. Assess your feelings with a practical perspective.",Taurus
"Dec 16, 2022 - Bring stability to your emotions today, Taurus. You have the tendency to take things to extremes, swinging from incredible highs to rock-bottom lows. Give your nervous system a break and calm down. Go for a walk in the woods. Make sure that all your actions are rational and well planned. See to it that you're in control of your emotions before you interact with others.",Taurus
"Dec 17, 2022 - If you aren't careful about the energy you dish out today, Taurus, you will find that it all comes back to smack you in the face. Other people are likely to be as stubborn as you, so proceed cautiously. The more you try to control and manipulate others, the more friction will build. Things are likely to explode. Adopt a friendly attitude and try not to take anything too seriously.",Taurus
"Dec 18, 2022 - You may feel a little weary today, Taurus. It's a good time to take stock of your life. You may have gotten some news about someone that has caused you some pain. This is a good time to rely on the support of your relationship in order to reenergize yourself. Take the time to let others take care of you.",Taurus
"Dec 19, 2022 - Today take stock of all that's occurring on the home front, Taurus. Think back over the last few months and you will see how much of your attention has been on work rather than loved ones. There's probably some fallout as a result. Fortunately, a few days in close touch with family will put everything right. You can't blame them for wanting to be with you. Try to indulge them.",Taurus
"Dec 20, 2022 - Nothing is simple where your family is concerned. If you've forgotten that, don't worry. Today will remind you. You may have to deal with some of your lingering problems with certain family members. You will find you have all the energy you need in order to find the solutions to the conflicts that have been eating at you for a while.",Taurus
"Dec 21, 2022 - You will find that your emotions are much more under control today, Taurus. You're able to strike a happy balance and avoid extraordinary extremes that scare others away. In fact, quite the opposite is true. People will be attracted to you as you provide a life raft on turbulent waters. Your sensitivity is strong and you're able to immediately fix on the status of any situation.",Taurus
"Dec 22, 2022 - Things should go well for you today, Taurus. There's an added serenity in the air that will help calm your nerves. There's no need to make things more complicated than necessary. The answers to things are actually quite simple. Everything you want is probably right at your fingertips. You don't need to go far to find what you seek.",Taurus
"Dec 23, 2022 - This isn't a day to make firm commitments, Taurus, especially concerning relationships. Today's atmosphere highlights unification and reconciliation, but don't take this as a sign that you're now bound for life. Proceed carefully before making any long-term decisions. If you're about to take a big step at work or in your personal life, try to delay your decision until your thoughts are clearer.",Taurus
"Dec 24, 2022 - You're feeling confident and more comfortable in your own skin than you have in a long time, Taurus. You're so accomplished, why are you the last one to acknowledge it? Try to look up from your desk long enough to socialize with friends and loved ones. You've been so focused on work that your relationships may have suffered a bit. Spend some quality time with those you care about, if possible.",Taurus
"Dec 25, 2022 - Things are on the upswing for you today, Taurus. People are finally coming around to see things from your perspective. There's no need to doubt yourself. Look in the mirror and know that the person you see is capable of accomplishing anything. Your powerful emotions are your allies. Don't be afraid to let your heart speak up loudly and clearly, the way it wants to.",Taurus
"Dec 26, 2022 - You will keep a level head today, Taurus, so take this opportunity to make rational decisions about the most intense issues on the table. Stay grounded and concentrate on what you need to do. Don't get caught up in the usual emotional drama. Restriction and limitation are main themes of the day that will help you reach your goals.",Taurus
"Dec 27, 2022 - Strength of character will be your partner today, Taurus. You seem to have an aura whose intensity scares some people and attracts others. Your force of character could be the cause of some wonderful feelings and emotions for the people close to you. Don't try and hide your emotions. They're the source of your creativity.",Taurus
"Dec 28, 2022 - Even if you're a good judge of character, Taurus, the people who know you say that you base your opinions on your personal feelings, which often affect your good judgment. Today your critics are wrong, and your judgments are as precise and objective as they can possibly be. They may even help you out of a sticky situation.",Taurus
"Dec 29, 2022 - You may have to stand by certain difficult, worrisome decisions today, Taurus. You may feel a kind of urgent need for stability in your personal life. What is really behind this feeling? Is it possible that you're just afraid of your desire to put everything into question in order to make a fresh start? Today you may find the answer to this question. Stay tuned.",Taurus
"Dec 30, 2022 - You may feel extra self-confident today, Taurus, making you more able to say and do the things you might normally keep inside. Be warned, however, that you're apt to run into some powerful, unexpected opposition. The genius in you wants to come out and show others what you're made of, but other people may have reason to find fault. Don't let others' disapproval hinder your progress.",Taurus
"Dec 31, 2022 - You will be able to find a greater connection to your inner soul today, Taurus. You will also find that you're more psychic than usual. Trust your intuition. The more you look inward, the more you're apt to find the solutions to your outward questions. Combine a sense of dreamy emotion with a grounded feeling of love and beauty. You may need to balance your cloudy head with stable roots.",Taurus
"Feb 4, 2023 - Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Gemini, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.",Gemini

"Feb 4, 2022 - It won't be surprising if you find yourself getting frustrated with a close friend or partner today who is far less ambitious than you, Gemini. The energy in the air can really emphasize your “go, go, go” way of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful in this area may be difficult to understand. Yet each person has to do things in ways that are best for him or her. Try to be patient.",Gemini
"Feb 5, 2022 - Welcome to another great day, Gemini. The energy from the day's aspects is positive and encouraging when it comes to communication and interaction with others. Why not take advantage of this? Get together to visit with friends and family and enjoy yourself. Consider inviting people over for a game or dinner. Even a potluck can be a lot of fun. You work hard all the time, so play hard today!",Gemini
"Feb 6, 2022 - Today may be a good day for you to spend some time creating, Gemini. While you may love sports, you also have an innate artistic streak. The joy of creating something is immeasurable, and the process of producing a finished product can be very enjoyable and therapeutic. Crafts, baking, building, and gardening are all activities conducive to this. Take time to express yourself through your favorite hobbies today.",Gemini
"Feb 7, 2022 - You may feel that you have to defend your motives today, Gemini, and this can really put you off, especially if you can't see a reason for it. Try not to take it personally. Just because you know where you're coming from doesn't mean the other person does. It may simply be a communication problem. Make the effort to clarify your position. If this doesn't suffice, it isn’t your problem any more. The other person will have to look at his or her trust issues.",Gemini
"Feb 8, 2022 - It's a great day to explore your creativity, Gemini. This probably isn’t a new thing for you, since you’re artistic. Staying focused on one thing can be another story, though. Today's energy can give you the extra concentration you need to get a creative project completed. Make the most of this by either finishing something you started earlier or tackling a new project. Have fun expressing yourself and creating!",Gemini
"Feb 9, 2022 - An opportunity to travel could come your way today, Gemini, perhaps in the company of friends or colleagues. This might involve education in some way. What you learn on this trip is likely to alter your life somehow, as it could open new doors for you. New friends and valuable contacts could also come on the scene. Don't hesitate; go for it! Another opportunity like this might not come around for a while.",Gemini
"Feb 10, 2022 - Success and good fortune might be in the wind for you today, Gemini. Whatever it is will probably have you feeling especially elated and satisfied with your accomplishments. You'll want to tell everyone, but this could prove frustrating since some of the people you want to tell might not be reachable today. Hold off on spreading the word until you can inform those closest to you. You'll need and want their support.",Gemini
"Feb 11, 2022 - The establishment of a new business partnership could require a lot of paperwork today, Gemini. It might be really tedious trying to make sense of all the jargon involved, but it's important to you, so you're likely to be more persistent than usual. Someone more familiar with these matters could explain the ins and outs to you. This is likely to be a very fortunate development for you, so don't lose heart. Hang in there!",Gemini
"Feb 12, 2022 - Your internal fire may be feeling a bit smothered by a fierce reality check today, Gemini. Give people the benefit of the doubt. They are more perceptive than you may think. In fact, it may behoove you to get some honest feedback today from some people you trust. It could be difficult for you to sort out the truth in your present situation, since you’re the one caught in the middle of the maelstrom. Consider the perspective of another.",Gemini
"Feb 13, 2022 - Attempts to contact others in different states or foreign countries today could go awry, Gemini, as technology that we tend to take for granted, such as telephones and the Internet, could malfunction, perhaps due to solar flares. There isn't much point in making yourself crazy, as this is beyond human control. The only thing you can do is wait! In the meantime, do something else that you love.",Gemini
"Feb 14, 2022 - If you've been thinking about starting a new business partnership, Gemini, this is the day to take some positive action toward that end. Any new business enterprises started today, particularly involving partnerships, show a lot of promise for success. This might make a profound difference in the course of your life, so make sure you allow for as many contingencies as you can. Go for the gold and enjoy the adventure!",Gemini
"Feb 15, 2022 - Your intuition, physical and intellectual energy, and insight are at an all-time high today, Gemini. You'll probably want to spend much of the day alone, reflecting on your ideas and deciding how you want to put them to work for you. At some point, you may want to put your thoughts in writing. You could also tune in more strongly than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others.",Gemini
"Feb 16, 2022 - The healing of a temporary rift with your partner is likely to take place today, with a lot of honest communication and more apologies than are necessary. You might find that a lot of issues have come out in the open and that there is a new understanding between the two of you. A move could be coming up, Gemini, or at least changes within the household you have now.",Gemini
"Feb 17, 2022 - You’re feeling especially psychically and mystically inclined today, Gemini. You might want to read about such matters or attend a lecture or workshop given by someone in the field. Telepathic communications are coming your way. Don't be surprised if more than once during the course of the day you and another say the same thing at the same time. You might also experience a powerful kinship with people from the past.",Gemini
"Feb 18, 2022 - Finances may cause an upset between you and a friend today, Gemini. Perhaps this person owes you money and can't pay it back, or vice versa. If this is the case, try to work out some kind of arrangement that suits you both. There's always a way to create a win-win situation if you don't both get so angry that your objectivity is totally wiped out. Stay calm and focused and all should be well. Hang in there.",Gemini
"Feb 19, 2022 - An emotional issue with a family member could have you wanting to run away and hide, Gemini. Don't fight the urge. This may be just what you need in order to clear your mind regarding the problem and heal your wounded psyche before you face this person again. You might also receive some rather disconcerting revelations about yourself and old traumas that you’ve long since forgotten. Don't fight these either. Simply release them.",Gemini
"Feb 20, 2022 - Too much mental or physical exercise could have you feeling a bit burned out today, Gemini. You could be considerably slower on the uptake than usual, and those around you could be surprised that you, normally very energetic, seem to be moving like a snail. Spend as much time resting as you can, because you'll need to recoup your stamina. If you must work, concentrate on routine tasks requiring very little conscious effort.",Gemini
"Feb 21, 2022 - Financial prosperity is just around the corner, Gemini, especially with your recently acquired money-management skills. It’s likely that you’ll receive a windfall in the near future, although it may not seem like a windfall to you, since you’ve been expecting this money for a long time now. Use your new abilities to invest it soundly and wisely. You’re bound to be quite pleased with the results you achieve over the long term.",Gemini
"Feb 22, 2022 - Today you could sit down at the computer for just a minute to research something on the Internet and wind up spending most of the afternoon entranced by what you're reading, Gemini. You could very well stumble upon some information on the occult and mysticism. It’s always fascinated you, and now that you've begun learning, you don't want to stop. Perhaps you could enroll in a workshop and mingle with others who share a similar interest.",Gemini
"Feb 23, 2022 - You tend to be very intuitive, Gemini, but today your channel to the other side could appear to be totally blocked. You can't sense what others are feeling, and oracles like the I Ching just don't make sense any more. You may try to fall back on logic, but that doesn't work today either. Don't think this is a permanent situation, however. Your mental biorhythms are low. You should be back to normal in a few days.",Gemini
"Feb 24, 2022 - You have an innate psychic ability that only needs some fine-tuning and strengthening for it to develop into a formidable power. Even now you sometimes find yourself reading other people's thoughts. This sensitivity gets you into trouble sometimes, but mostly it works to your advantage. In relationships, especially, you’re able to put an end to hurt feelings before they evolve into something irreparable.",Gemini
"Feb 25, 2022 - Try not to let yourself get sucked into participating in idle gossip, Gemini. There will be rumors flying today, and you’d be well advised to take cover. While it’s true that there is some truth to the gossip, the embellishments to the story have blown everything out of proportion. Feelings are likely to get hurt. If you don’t want yours to be among them, steer clear of the water cooler.",Gemini
"Feb 26, 2022 - You have an active mind and an even more active imagination, Gemini. Today you risk short-circuiting your brain as you struggle to keep up with all the ideas and information swirling inside your head. Take a few minutes to do a mental inventory. Write down everything you're thinking right now so you can free some space in your brain for other issues. A long walk or jog would help soothe your mind.",Gemini
"Feb 27, 2022 - Today, Gemini, you could direct an overwhelming amount of love and passion toward a current or potential romantic partner. Your friend might feel a little taken aback, but is likely to be flattered and therefore respond in a positive manner. This might not have the potential to become a committed relationship, so don't expect anything from it. Just get to know each other, see where the bond takes you, and go with the flow.",Gemini
"Feb 28, 2022 - You can expect to run a lot of errands today, Gemini, even though you would probably prefer to stay at home. You have obligations to fulfill for friends and family, and you can't bear to let them down. Try to get everything done as quickly as possible so that you'll still have the afternoon free for yourself.",Gemini
"Feb 4, 2023 - Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Gemini, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.",Gemini

"Mar 1, 2022 - Gemini, one or more of your co-workers could appear to be rather upset or depressed on the job today, and this is likely to affect your own efficiency. Your colleagues in question aren't going to be very much into communicating, so it's best just to turn a blind eye and keep on working in spite of the situation. It's going to be tougher than usual, but it's nothing you can't handle.",Gemini
"Mar 2, 2022 - Enjoy a spirited day in which you indulge in everything your heart desires, Gemini. Your imagination could take you to a whole new realm in which you play the starring role. Live these fantasies. Remember that if you can dream it, you can do it, so think big. The fire inside you burns brightly, so make good use of this power before it's squandered away by someone else tugging on the strings.",Gemini
"Mar 3, 2022 - Today you might hear a rather distressing rumor about one or more people you know or perhaps about your working situation. Don't be surprised if more than one person phones or emails to fill you in on this. However, Gemini, this information might not be dependable. It could be based on innuendo or even outright lies. Try to track down the facts before you make yourself crazy over it.",Gemini
"Mar 4, 2022 - Today is likely to prove very busy, Gemini, and full of interesting, unusual developments. You might find yourself having to run a lot of errands in your neighborhood, perhaps also making a few short visits. A lot of letters and phone calls, some with intriguing news, could also be on your agenda at this time. It could take some time for you to process all the information and make sense of it.",Gemini
"Mar 5, 2022 - This is your day, Gemini, so don't waste it. Being the helpful, friendly person you are, you may find yourself catering to other people's needs and desires. Some could see you as the good Samaritan who can offer advice with a friendly attitude. Be careful of draining away all your energy on others. This day might be better spent by catering to you. Even though this seems selfish, you'll love yourself for it.",Gemini
"Mar 6, 2022 - Take a break from your routine, Gemini. You might feel like you're leading an army into battle as you strive for new adventures and conquer new realms. Make sure you take a bit of time out today to stop and let your troops rest. You deserve a little rest yourself. Use this moment of stillness to form your plan of attack so you're sure about how to proceed.",Gemini
"Mar 7, 2022 - Parts of your life might seem like gladiatorial games out of ancient Rome. The good news is that if anyone can rise above this situation and see the truth in the matter, it's you, Gemini. Be careful to not be too obstinate about how to resolve things. This is likely to get you deeper into a mess that you shouldn't have to deal with in the first place. Your job is to mediate not dictate.",Gemini
"Mar 8, 2022 - Communications with family members and others should be clear, honest, and loving. Although your physical passions may be surging beneath the surface today, Gemini, they're still very much present. You're likely to be feeling particularly romantic, and might want to read racy novels or go to a sexy movie. This is the night to be alone with that special person. Make sure you look your best. Have fun!",Gemini
"Mar 9, 2022 - You may find it difficult to take action on any practical matter today, Gemini. If you find this is the case, don't bother pressuring yourself into making it happen. Today you're more concerned with the fanciful side of life. Daydreams can be a wonderful escape for you today. Do something that will take you out of your current frame of mind. Go see a movie or play this evening.",Gemini
"Mar 10, 2022 - Whether or not you willingly participate, you'll certainly play a key role in the action, Gemini. At times you'll feel like the pivotal player whose actions decide the fate of the game. Now you must close your eyes, take a deep breath, and find the answer from your heart. Don't look to others for support, because they'll have their own agendas and ideas about what you should do. Only you know what is best.",Gemini
"Mar 11, 2022 - You may be feeling a strong sense of guilt now because of something you did in an effort to feed your ego, Gemini. Be aware of how your actions have affected others and apologize. Guilt is basically a useless emotion that you should get rid of as quickly as possible. Don't let this feeling keep you from opening up your heart to restore it to its original innocence.",Gemini
"Mar 12, 2022 - In general, things should be going extremely well for you today, Gemini, so don't miss this opportunity to pursue your dreams in every sense of the word. Do things with passion and don't hold back. Remember that your mind and will are the only things stopping you from getting where you want to be. There's a great deal of magnetism at your disposal today, so enlist others to help you.",Gemini
"Mar 13, 2022 - Your outgoing and jovial nature is intensified today, Gemini, and so you're probably going to be sought after for any parties or celebrations. Your generosity is also at an all-time high, and will take many forms, which will be appreciated by that special someone in your life. Think about taking your partner with you as you make the social rounds tonight and making him or her the star of the evening.",Gemini
"Mar 14, 2022 - This is a great time to take advantage of a little solitude to pursue some cherished goals, Gemini. Your concentration and imagination are operating at a very high level, and you may not stop working until you're completely finished. If you're starting a project, you'll probably do well on it and, if business and money are involved, be successful. Don't let temporary snags get in your way. Go for the gold!",Gemini
"Mar 15, 2022 - Group activities could take up a lot of your time and energy today, perhaps too much. Your career concerns are very much on your mind, and you don't like being distracted from them. Nonetheless, these activities, not to mention your family, are important to you, Gemini, and you'll find a way to squeeze them in even though it's frustrating. Remember, this isn't a good day to push yourself too hard!",Gemini
"Mar 16, 2022 - It's a good thing you have a flexible attitude, Gemini, especially today. Your adaptive powers could be put to the test as you find yourself surrounded by fickle emotions and stubborn attitudes. Don't get too hung up on getting straight answers from people today, for they're apt to be just as confused as you about certain issues. Play it cool for now and ride the waves easily to shore.",Gemini
"Mar 17, 2022 - A new business opportunity may come your way, Gemini. You aren't likely to want to commit to a permanent involvement, but you might take it on temporarily simply for the sake of the money. Perhaps you want to make some changes in your home, such as new furniture or paint. Whatever comes your way, you'll probably put a lot of energy into it and accomplish it all. Go for it!",Gemini
"Mar 18, 2022 - You have the opportunity to do some intense self-healing today, Gemini, so you communicate more directly with your core self without the distractions of other people. Do what you can to hone in on the internal issues that require your attention. It's key that you learn how to address these issues yourself instead of relying on other people to take care of these needs for you today.",Gemini
"Mar 19, 2022 - Today you might try to continue or complete a creative project of some kind, but your imagination just isn't working the way it normally does. Also, overindulgence from last night could have you feeling a bit sluggish, which doesn't help the situation. Put your work aside before you give up on it completely, Gemini. This is only a temporary situation. Your mind should be back to normal tomorrow.",Gemini
"Mar 20, 2022 - This will be a good day for you, Gemini. You should be feeling happy, excited, enthusiastic, and optimistic about the future. Relations with family, friends, and neighbors are likely to be warm and congenial. Today could involve a lot of time on the phone or out running errands. Expect a surprise encounter with someone you haven't seen in a long time. You'll spend some time reminiscing and catching up.",Gemini
"Mar 21, 2022 - You should feel exhilarated today, Gemini. You might choose to channel some of this enthusiasm into decorating your home. Your aesthetic sense is sharp, as is your physical energy, so once you set upon a particular course of action, you aren't likely to abandon it. Family members or others close to you may join you and create an atmosphere of strong companionship. Make an impromptu party of it. Get going, and enjoy yourself!",Gemini
"Mar 22, 2022 - A lot of paperwork, perhaps involving contracts, could lead to financial gain on the job, Gemini. You could make or save some money for your employer, which could prove important. Expect some sort of acknowledgement or recognition for your efforts from superiors, which could lead to advancement or a possible raise. However, there may be some delay with regard to the latter. Don't expect it right away.",Gemini
"Mar 23, 2022 - The study of psychology might be especially appealing today, Gemini. Some new discoveries that you may have heard about in the media could have piqued your interest and might propel you to the library to find books on the subject. This is a good time to pursue this. Your mind is in the right space to understand it, and it could shed a lot of light on those around you, including you!",Gemini
"Mar 24, 2022 - Are you feeling a little under the weather, Gemini? You may have been burning the candle at both ends. The obvious tip would be to slow down, but you might feel it isn't possible now. Get as much rest as you can and be sure to eat right. Ask for help if urgent work needs to be done. That way it will get done quickly even if your energy level isn't up to snuff.",Gemini
"Mar 25, 2022 - You could make a trip to the library today, Gemini, as you may need to track down some intellectual, spiritual, or practical information required for a task or project you're working on. You may find yourself spending more time there than you'd originally planned, as you might discover facts or ideas that open up fascinating new trains of thought. If your time is limited, keep track of the hour. If not, have fun!",Gemini
"Mar 26, 2022 - You may receive some upsetting news from a family member today, Gemini. It could have you reeling for a moment, but when you take the time to think about it some more you'll realize that things aren't as troubling as they first seemed. Be sure to get all the facts before taking any action. You want to be sure to do what's right in this situation.",Gemini
"Mar 27, 2022 - Have you been reading romantic novels or watching romantic films lately, Gemini? This is probably because love is very much on your mind now. You may be involved in a passionate relationship or hoping for one. If it's the latter, don't expect to remain alone for very long. All signs indicate that romance is going to become a top priority for you for a while, starting now. Make sure you look your best whenever you go out!",Gemini
"Mar 28, 2022 - The desire to make a particular purchase could have you reworking your budget today, Gemini. This is a good time to do this, as your business and money sense are operating at a high level, and you're likely to be savvier about finance than usual. You may take more time than you need, however. Remember not to beat it to death or you'll lose your focus. Don't be afraid to take breaks. Good luck!",Gemini
"Mar 29, 2022 - A social event in your neighborhood could connect you with people who share your spiritual and intellectual inclinations, Gemini. As a result, you'll probably make some new friends and spend a lot of time on the phone with them over the next few days. If you're single, one could be a potential love partner. If you're a writer or artist, expect oodles of inspiration to hit you as a result of all this.",Gemini
"Mar 30, 2022 - A proposed get-together with a love interest might have to be postponed until much later tonight or perhaps another evening, %. This could make you a little blue. Your insecurity might even get the better of you. Does your friend not want to meet? Don't fall into this kind of thinking. Accept that there's a reason and go with the flow. You'll enjoy the date that much more for the delay.",Gemini
"Mar 31, 2022 - Today you could feel torn between the desire to get a little exercise and a powerful inclination to curl up in your favorite chair and catch up on some reading, Gemini. There isn't any reason why you can't do both. Go out for a brisk walk and then reach for a favorite book when you return. The key isn't giving up on one, but attaining a balance between the two.",Gemini
"Apr 1, 2022 - You could find yourself staring at a stranger for just one extra second as you pass on the street today, Gemini. Your tendency toward the new and bizarre is stronger than usual, and you're being pulled into different mental directions. Go ahead and introduce yourself to that stranger. Perhaps he or she will become a business partner or new best friend. You never know until you ask.",Gemini
"Apr 2, 2022 - You might talk as if you possess many lifetimes of wisdom, Gemini. Perhaps you do, but that doesn't mean you should be arrogant about it. Your words might have the tone of a sage schooled in every subject. As a result, you could grow frustrated with others who act immature or uneducated. It isn't your job to judge. Help others understand the bigger picture instead of assume they're unworthy or unwilling to learn.",Gemini
"Apr 3, 2022 - Regardless of your situation, Gemini, you'll want to take the easy way out. There's a laziness sweeping over you, and you could be trying to find a way to sneak out of some responsibilities. Even if this idea seems terrific now, it's likely to get you into some trouble later. Be wary of cheating the system and then expecting the full benefits of hard work in return. You'll earn exactly what you deserve.",Gemini
"Apr 4, 2022 - You could have an urge to invent new things, Gemini. You feel compelled to create something in the artistic, technical, or philosophical field. If only you'd give yourself enough time to pursue these ideas! Today, realize that concentration is the key to accomplishment. Put away periodicals, computers, phones, and other such distractions and you might well be surprised by the wealth of inspiration that comes to you.",Gemini
"Apr 5, 2022 - You're likely to find people somewhat irritating today, Gemini. It's as though nothing is good enough, and nobody seems to know exactly what he or she wants. You'll reign supreme within this maze of overt conflict and dissatisfaction. You might even be asked to step in and restore order. If the conflict is domestic, go ahead. But tread carefully if you're asked to be the sheriff at the office!",Gemini
"Apr 6, 2022 - Someone you've wanted to hear from for a long time, perhaps an old friend who lives far away, could ring you up today while you're out, Gemini. You'll be happy to get the message, but it could result in a frustrating game of phone tag throughout the day. Don't get so irritated you give up. Keep trying. You'll eventually touch base, and you'll be glad you did!",Gemini
"Apr 7, 2022 - Today you might decide to attend a group activity that is primarily concerned with an intellectual, philosophical, or spiritual interest of yours, Gemini. You might meet a charismatic person whose conversation stimulates your mind and causes you to come up with new insights. During the course of the day, you might notice that this person is very appealing to you, and you could imagine getting romantically involved at some point.",Gemini
"Apr 8, 2022 - Today you could receive an invitation to a social event that you'll really want to attend, Gemini. People could be there who might turn out to be important contacts. Nonetheless, you might find that other responsibilities interfere with your plans, and experience a wave of disappointment. If you're creative, you will find a way to fulfill your obligations and attend the event, too. Think about it!",Gemini
"Apr 9, 2022 - A colleague could be in a very bad mood, Gemini, and therefore not the easiest person in the world to deal with. In fact, today he or she could resist working at all, and you might feel obligated to take up the slack. Only do it if the tasks are urgent. It isn't fair to you to have to do someone else's job. Don't feel guilty if you leave it unfinished.",Gemini
"Apr 10, 2022 - If you've been worrying about having spent too much recently, Gemini, the astral configuration indicates you should be able to put those worries behind you. There are plenty of opportunities that could bring increased income, possibly a new job, even a new career. A lot of phone calls, emails, or other communications could bring news of these possibilities your way. Be sure to record the ones that seem most promising.",Gemini
"Apr 11, 2022 - Group activities, perhaps with a social, ecological, or humanitarian focus, could take place today somewhere in your neighborhood, Gemini. You might decide to attend with your romantic partner. You could encounter some friends in the process, and all of you could well be caught up in the excitement generated by those in the spotlight. Listen well and think about what you learn today. It might make a difference in your future.",Gemini
"Apr 12, 2022 - If you aren't careful, there's a strong possibility that you'll overindulge today, Gemini. Your career frustrations may manifest in the form of overeating, excess drinking, or reckless spending. These are just symptoms masking the real problem. If you can take some time to meditate, you'll calm your nerves and reveal the root of your frustration. Once you have the facts, it will be easier to devise an effective solution.",Gemini
"Apr 13, 2022 - Some pretty heavy soul searching could reveal that the time has come to make use of a talent you may have always had but never developed. This could involve nothing more than a little practice, or you could decide to get some formal training in the skill. This is a positive sign, Gemini, but your determination could waver over the next few days. Don't hesitate - stay with it!",Gemini
"Apr 14, 2022 - Travel is in store today, Gemini. It could be a spur-of-the-moment trip with a friend. More likely, it will be a series of short trips closer to home. You could visit friends or take advantage of sales and do some shopping. Your active mind will pick up on all sorts of ideas for improving your home. Once the errands are done, go home and look at your space with a fresh eye. There is a lot you can do to improve it.",Gemini
"Apr 15, 2022 - Things could be up and down for you today, Gemini. You might experience some confusion as a result of communication snafus or computer glitches that affect financial issues you're trying to solve. Persevere and you'll succeed. Don't be surprised if you're recruited to join a project that is totally new to you. You may be apprehensive at first, but you'll do just fine. Go ahead and say yes.",Gemini
"Apr 16, 2022 - You'll have to let go of your usual drill-sergeant manner and simply let the day unfold as it will. Try as you might, even you won't be able to direct events today, Gemini. You could find your attention diverted from one project to another. It isn't an unpleasant day but a disjointed one. Stay open to all possibilities. You could be surprised by the way things turn out.",Gemini
"Apr 17, 2022 - You have a strong spirit of cooperation today, Gemini. It inspires you to pitch in and help others without being asked. Your romantic partner could be surprised to see you show up and help with a chore. Never mind that you don't know what you're doing - you'll figure it out. Others will be impressed to see you going above and beyond what you've been asked to do. Your efforts on all fronts won't go unnoticed.",Gemini
"Apr 18, 2022 - You're likely to wake up today with a compulsion to clean or organize something, Gemini. This may be rather unlike you. If we didn't know better we'd say that you were feeling a parental urge, and your nesting instinct is kicking in. Indulge your domestic desires today. Tomorrow you're probably going to be in quite a different frame of mind!",Gemini
"Apr 19, 2022 - Today there are many areas in which you can shine, Gemini. You need only be yourself to win over the hearts of others. There is a graciousness to your manner that draws people close to you, whether or not you've ever noticed it before. Realize this, and know that it isn't a fluke. You need not take much action. It will come to you.",Gemini
"Apr 20, 2022 - This could be a very busy day in your community, Gemini. Some kind of rally, protest, or other public gathering might take place. If you attend, you may not hear much because of all the noise, and the event could seem disorganized at best. It could also render traffic impossible! If you can, stay home today. Going out could be more trouble than it's worth. Protest with your vote or your wallet instead.",Gemini
"Apr 21, 2022 - Tonight you might decide to attend a social gathering held in your community that involves a lot of people who are into psychic or spiritual matters, Gemini. This should be an interesting experience for you, because you could not only glean a lot of fascinating information but also make some new friends. Someone could recommend a few intriguing books. Keep your eyes and ears open, and take your address book with you. Have fun!",Gemini
"Apr 22, 2022 - A desire to spruce up your home might start with a thorough cleaning from attic to basement, Gemini. You could go through that chore like gangbusters and then do some repairs or go for the fun stuff, such as redecorating with plants or even some new furniture. You can have a lot of fun with this, especially if your partner or friends help out. Work hard and enjoy your day!",Gemini
"Apr 23, 2022 - Today would be best spent alone behind closed doors, if possible. There's a lot of tension in your household for some reason, Gemini. Since there isn't much you can do about it, try to avoid it altogether. Let your family members fight it out among themselves. You have better ways to spend your time. Why not take in a movie? When you go by yourself, you don't have to share the popcorn!",Gemini
"Apr 24, 2022 - It can be hard to release old habits and beliefs even as new, better ways of thinking struggle to gain a foothold. It's time for you to do this, Gemini. You might find it difficult to confide your feelings to another, but a frank conversation with close friends will do much to ease your mind. There's no question that you're changing. Your friends will show you that this transformation is positive.",Gemini
"Apr 25, 2022 - If you've been feeling a little under the weather, today's planetary configuration will make you feel a whole lot better, Gemini. In a few days you'll have the strength to pick up where you left off on the projects you perhaps began last month. A lot of things are changing in your life. Your motivations are evolving and your ambitions could be taking a different direction.",Gemini
"Apr 26, 2022 - As you get older, you're drawn more and more to spiritual matters, Gemini. It isn't so much that you're embracing any particular religion, more that you're quite curious about the supernatural and some of the ancient arts. Take some time today to visit the library or bookstore and do some reading on the subject. You might want to form a study group with other like-minded individuals.",Gemini
"Apr 27, 2022 - A strange person promoting him- or herself as a mind-reader of sorts could come onto the scene today, Gemini. This person, however, is more mixed up than mindful. Therefore, take any predictions with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. Chances are good that none of them have any basis in reality. Trust your intuition. Your insights should be far more dependable than those of the so-called psychic.",Gemini
"Apr 28, 2022 - Ideas for a new enterprise, which could be anything from a party to a vacation to a new business, could have you spending a lot of time on the phone today, Gemini. You'll need to consult with people who know about what you want to do and at least lay the groundwork for making solid arrangements. Some of what you hear may be confusing, but don't be afraid to ask for an explanation. Go to it!",Gemini
"Apr 29, 2022 - Today you might take up some sort of occult study, such as astrology, numerology, or alchemy that seems like Greek to you at first, Gemini. As a result, you could be tempted to abandon it. Don't! Once you get past the jargon, you'll probably find it fascinating. Keep a dictionary handy, and don't worry if you have to go over something several times. You have the brains to do it. Now just put in the time.",Gemini
"Apr 30, 2022 - If you admit you've made a mistake, people are more likely to forgive you. You have a confrontational day ahead, Gemini. There's no doubt that you're in a stationary position concerning your career. That may be crimping your style somewhat, financially speaking, but you'll make better progress if you assume your responsibility and see your mistakes. However, don't be too critical of yourself! It's all part of the learning process.",Gemini
"Feb 4, 2023 - Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Gemini, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.",Gemini
"May 1, 2022 - Your mind is in great turmoil right now, Gemini, so it isn't surprising that you can't pay much attention to anything. It's as though your concept of the world has been inexorably changed and you see your love life and career with new eyes. Even so, you feel compelled to pick up the pieces of the past and save them. The day ahead should help you let go of the old world.",Gemini
"May 2, 2022 - In some ways, you may feel like a lost soul who isn't quite in touch with your dreams, Gemini. Although you feel energetic and boisterous, you might also get the sense that your energy is misdirected and you're being led in the wrong direction. The key for you now is to lead yourself. Cut through everyone else's agenda and follow your internal rainbow. The more you take charge, the happier you'll be.",Gemini
"May 3, 2022 - Today is excellent for just letting your intuition guide you, Gemini. If you have time, you might want to let your mind go and follow the train of thought wherever it takes you. You could find something out about yourself of which you unaware, something just waiting to be noticed. Remember, your desires are fantasies before they become realties, so dream a little.",Gemini
"May 4, 2022 - The promise of a promotion or raise could be on your mind today, Gemini. You might try to visualize the next steps and anticipate tasks that take more effort and concentration than you're used to. Don't panic. It's better to not push yourself so hard. Wait a few days until the planets relax a little and just do what you need to do - no more, no less. You'll be successful in the long run.",Gemini
"May 5, 2022 - A number of visitors could come to your home today, Gemini, and a number of fascinating subjects could come up in the course of your conversation. Some interesting ideas might come directly or indirectly from these discussions. You might want to put them to use formulating plans of action to make your future more fulfilling. Professional, financial, and spiritual opportunities could all open up for you. Go for it!",Gemini
"May 6, 2022 - You have a great deal of physical energy, Gemini. At times, you may feel as if you have an endless wellspring of power. You're at a climactic point in your yearly cycle, when things are coming to a dramatic apex. Difficulties that pertain to this climax are likely to make you act out in an aggressive manner if things don't go your way. Find a constructive outlet for all this physical energy.",Gemini
"May 7, 2022 - For you, Gemini, love is like an adventure, crazy sport, or some sort of video arcade game. Lately, you may have been too caught up in the fantasy aspect of it without taking into account the practical nature and nitty-gritty of what it takes to keep a relationship afloat. You might need to take a more realistic view of it now. Be more sensitive to your emotions and honor them accordingly.",Gemini
"May 8, 2022 - Have you felt somewhat lost for the past few days? The fog may lift today and enable you to situate yourself at last. You're probably eager to settle a question that has nagged at you and interfered with your judgment. However, you should be patient, especially if it has to do with emotional matters. Try to understand, but don't take immediate action. You'll be more objective beginning tomorrow.",Gemini
"May 9, 2022 - Today you should abandon any intellectual pursuits and concentrate on practical problems related to organization and goal setting. You're likely to find perfect solutions within an hour of starting. The heavens are helping you, Gemini. Give them some credit for your ingenuity, and waste no time in implementing your plans!",Gemini
"May 10, 2022 - Don't let your fear or anger get the better of you today, Gemini. You're going to be pushed to the forefront and you may even be forced to make some big decisions regarding the direction of your professional life. Perhaps you've been feeling that it's a little premature to take action, but, frankly, you no longer have any choice. Whether you know it or not, you're ready!",Gemini
"May 11, 2022 - Sometimes dreams seem like just that - dreams. Travel, a project, or a new home could be a few of the things you've been trying to accomplish for some time now. Making any one of these dreams come true possibly means jeopardizing relationships. Your dreams could seem particularly unattainable today. Perhaps you must first do some work on your relationships before you can realize your dreams.",Gemini
"May 12, 2022 - A chance to earn a small amount of money, perhaps by doing a little extra work at home, could come your way today, Gemini. You could hear about it through a friend or colleague. A visitor might come to your home, perhaps to help with something that needs to be done. This promises to be a very exciting day, with a lot of stimulation that could keep you occupied into the night.",Gemini
"May 13, 2022 - Today you're unstoppable! You're a very hard worker by nature, and with the current planetary alignment you'll be able to accomplish even more than usual. You have an abundance of energy, more than enough to handle everything that comes your way. Just be sure to use your usual good judgment. Rash decisions, especially those concerning your personal life, could lead to regret later.",Gemini
"May 14, 2022 - The topic of the day is knowledge and learning, Gemini. Did you study the field you dreamed of? Do you feel ashamed of not having attended such-and-such a school or program? If those sorts of issues are uppermost on your mind, remember that your creativity has little to do with the degrees you hold and everything to do with how you use your skills and knowledge to better the world.",Gemini
"May 15, 2022 - You're likely to find people somewhat irritating today, Gemini. It's as though nothing is good enough and nobody seems to know exactly what he or she wants. You'll reign supreme within this conflict and dissatisfaction. You may even be asked to step in and restore order. If the conflict is on the domestic front, go ahead. But tread carefully if you're asked to take on the role of sheriff!",Gemini
"May 16, 2022 - Be persistent and don't give up the fight today, Gemini. It might seem as if you aren't making progress and that it's harder to make decisions about anything. You'll find that other people are just as confused as you. Find a clever way to express what you feel. You can sort the issues out with the help of others as long as you're in touch with your inner state.",Gemini
"May 17, 2022 - Be careful not to lose your temper today, Gemini. You're chomping at the bit these days, although your daring nature has been reined in by financial and professional constraints. It's useless to entertain grandiose illusions at the moment. Moreover, if you do, you can expect some confrontations. If you're advised to be more conservative, heed the suggestion.",Gemini
"May 18, 2022 - How intense the past few days have been! You could spend months just reflecting on these recent experiences. But the mood isn't conducive to introspection right now. A change of temper today encourages you to share your life more generously. But with whom will you share it? That may well be the question of the day.",Gemini
"May 19, 2022 - Aspects of your life that you've neglected lately might haunt you on a day like today, Gemini. Make sure you're keeping up with all your responsibilities. Things may come to a dramatic climax at this time, and you could find yourself at an important crossroads. Nervous energy could cause you to run around frantically in search of the right path. Don't let indecision keep you from getting where you need to go.",Gemini
"May 20, 2022 - Give thanks to the people who are most precious to you, Gemini. You'll find that words cut to the core issues much more easily. Stabilize your strong emotions and use them as fuel for you endeavors. The key today is to remember those who have helped you along the way. Everyone is a sensitive and loving individual, so treat them as such. Have fun with the people all around you.",Gemini
"May 21, 2022 - There is the likelihood that you've been a bit of a loner lately. It's as though you decided to look at things differently from the rest of the world, rejecting the individualistic viewpoint in favor of a more global one. Today, you may achieve a new phase in this process. You may attain some summit of consciousness from which you finally have the ability to forgive!",Gemini
"May 22, 2022 - You could be wondering why everyone has to be so serious and emotional all of a sudden. You're likely to be feeling this way, too. Take this as a reminder that there are many different walks of life and not all of them necessarily intersect your path. Those forces are apt to make themselves known in quite a traumatic fashion today. Prepare to defend yourself and your motives, Gemini.",Gemini
"May 23, 2022 - Remember that you were put here to have fun, Gemini, and that happiness is your true destiny. Keep that in mind today, as forces may tend to pull you away from the fun you've been having. There is likely to be a sobering tone to the day that's stubbornly working to rain on your parade. Recognize the need for structure and stability, but don't let it bring you down.",Gemini
"May 24, 2022 - You might feel a little worn out right now, Gemini, as if you haven't been getting enough vitamins or rest. Or you could feel like you're losing track of issues that are important to you, such as your children's progress in school. You need to slow down a bit whether you want to or not. Today, give top priority to all the commonplace details of your daily life.",Gemini
"May 25, 2022 - Motivation must come from within, Gemini. The only thing that can pull you out of bed is your inner drive and determination. Too much partying could leave you drained to the point that you don't want to move. Remember moderation. Be good to your body. Go outside and let your thoughts radiate outward like rays of sunshine. Feel the ground beneath your feet.",Gemini
"May 26, 2022 - You may have been engaged in a battle with the facts lately, Gemini. Perhaps new information has forced you to take a step back as you contemplate the next move in your game plan. Research time is over and now you need to get back into the game with full force. When it comes to delicate issues regarding other people's property, you should make sure to be respectful at all times.",Gemini
"May 27, 2022 - You may need to keep your spaceship idle today and perform a safety check for your crew, Gemini. Make sure everyone on board is informed of the destination. It could be that you just picked them off the street without really telling them where they'd end up. It's important that you not drag people unwittingly into your world. If they voluntarily give the controls to you, however, that's a different story.",Gemini
"May 28, 2022 - The day should be fairly positive, Gemini, and you'll begin to feel the faintest hints of a major change beginning. This new phase will last seven months. As it progresses, you'll find greater freedom of expression. You can expect to shift into high gear in subjects you used to avoid. Some friction with siblings is likely to arise in the next few months.",Gemini
"May 29, 2022 - Make sure there's an equal amount of give and take in your day, Gemini. Sometimes when you love someone, you just want to keep giving and giving to demonstrate your incredible love. Be sure that you aren't draining yourself of valuable energy that you need for yourself, because maintaining your health is absolutely critical now. Also be sure that the people on the receiving end are also giving their fair share in return.",Gemini
"May 30, 2022 - Your wacky personality will be appreciated today, Gemini, but don't take it too far. Leave room for seriousness to enter the picture. There's a dreamy, cloudy sensation to the day that might make it difficult for you to concentrate on any one thing. If you pretend to know the answer when you don't, you'll only confuse the people who rely on your knowledge or authority. Respect that everyone wants answers these days.",Gemini
"May 31, 2022 - You may not feel like you're clicking with anything today, Gemini. For any kind of resolution, adjustments are needed, either by you or by the people you're dealing with. Your emotions may feel tied to the ground while your mind wants to take off into the stratosphere. Dilemmas between whether to take action or stay passive could leave you paralyzed. Just go with the flow.",Gemini
"Jun 1, 2022 - Today you should be glowing with good health, energy, and stamina, and be doing well at work, whether career, volunteer work, or a personal project. Success should come your way on all fronts, Gemini, particularly since you've been working hard. You're finally likely to see the results of past efforts. Success feeds good health and good health feeds success. Make the most of both.",Gemini
"Jun 2, 2022 - You may be in communication with some new people who appear interesting and excite your curiosity, Gemini. Spiritual or metaphysical conversations could take place today over the phone or video chat. The concepts might be deep, exalted, and inspiring, yet bring up more questions than answers. Books on the subject could prove enlightening. You might even want to write down your thoughts or memorialize them in a drawing or painting.",Gemini
"Jun 3, 2022 - Your enthusiasm for group activities and social events is high, Gemini. You might want to discuss your ideas with others. However, you could have trouble reaching people you need to speak with. This can be frustrating, but your enthusiasm isn't likely to flag because of it. Keep trying. Eventually you'll accomplish your goal. Whatever you plan today is likely to be gratifying even if the process is difficult.",Gemini
"Jun 4, 2022 - Friends, neighbors, and relatives could be feeling especially stressed out and explosive today, Gemini. This isn't a good day to initiate intense communications with them. Keep your talk light and inconsequential. This is a great day to stay home and read, especially since your mind is particularly receptive to unusual ideas. The Internet, videos, and TV documentaries could be most informative.",Gemini
"Jun 5, 2022 - Today you're likely to be more focused than usual on whatever it is you have to do, Gemini, whether chores around the house and yard or important projects of your own. Your mind is especially sharp and in tune with your feelings. Dreams and imaginings might prove to be valuable sources of inspiration. At some point, your mind might turn to travel, the acquisition of new knowledge, or both. Enjoy your day.",Gemini
"Jun 6, 2022 - Today could bring a lot of physical activity, possibly including workouts and dancing, as your energy, enthusiasm, and stamina are all high, Gemini. Life may be mentally demanding, too, but you can handle it. Communications with friends and colleagues should be warm, congenial, and full of good-natured banter. You could be exhausted but satisfied with everything you've done by the end of the day.",Gemini
"Jun 7, 2022 - Love and romance are apt to be your primary focus today, Gemini. If you're currently romantically involved, expect a wonderfully intense evening with your special someone if it’s possible you spend time together. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if someone new and exciting comes into your life, perhaps contacting you from another state or foreign country. Your creative abilities are also intensified. Take whatever time you need to memorize the ideas coming your way. You won't want to forget them.",Gemini
"Jun 8, 2022 - Have your friends ever told you that you could be a great teacher? At home, you're the one who's talking all the time. You're almost compelled to make others listen to you. Children are fascinated by your knowledge. Today, Gemini, someone might not agree with you and upset you. You'll learn that your lessons can lead to a conversation. Knowledge isn't a one-way street.",Gemini
"Jun 9, 2022 - Without a doubt, your day will have important consequences for the future of your love life. The doubts you may have today, especially concerning your feelings, are likely to push you to think about things before you make any decisions. Should you go back on what you've done or march on with conviction? This is what is at stake right now. Don't be too hasty about things.",Gemini
"Jun 10, 2022 - You enjoy caring for others and you intervene regularly in their lives to guide them. Ironically, today you're the one who needs advice. You'll probably need to get away from it all in order to get a clear view of your own life, Gemini. You could even decide to make the necessary arrangements for a trip abroad at some point in the future.",Gemini
"Jun 11, 2022 - Dreams or visions could put you in touch with deep feelings that you may not have been aware of before, Gemini. This could enable you to release traumas from your past and give you a new sense of lightness. However, your logical mind is very much at work, so you could use this experience to shed light on others' experiences and help them, too. Whatever happens today is likely to produce noticeable results.",Gemini
"Jun 12, 2022 - Insights shared by a family member could lead to possible ways to increase your income. Expect to handle a lot of paperwork regarding money, Gemini, but this is a positive development and definitely should leave you feeling good about your situation. This is a great day to do in-depth research. Your intuition is high and you're apt to see right through superficial appearances to the heart of any matter that interests you.",Gemini
"Jun 13, 2022 - Sometimes we all feel a little lost, Gemini. We often want to move mountains and use all our energy and enthusiasm to try to do so. But a few moments later we could feel that all efforts have been in vain. It pays to remember one of the hard facts of life - take nothing for granted. You shouldn't let that keep you from trying to make changes to things around you. Be vigilant.",Gemini
"Jun 14, 2022 - Unfortunately, today's planetary energy will place you in a rather uncomfortable situation, Gemini. You'll be the one having to smooth things over with your group of friends. Try not to impose your point of view. On the contrary, you should try to become more diplomatic and gentler with the people around you. You could also learn a lot by observing how people behave.",Gemini
"Jun 15, 2022 - You generally enjoy philosophy, metaphysics, and other forms of higher thought, Gemini, but today you could find yourself almost obsessive about them. You might decide to sequester yourself and concentrate on these concepts. This is a great day to do this because intellect combines with intuition to enable you to understand and make sense of abstract ideas. You can apply them to your everyday life. Go to it.",Gemini
"Jun 16, 2022 - The value of any investment you may have made in land, including your home, could come into your thoughts today. Whatever time and energy you've put into it is likely to pay off, Gemini, and this might make a difference to you when formulating plans for the future. You might spend some time working outside, which should clear your head and enable you to get your thoughts together. A female friend could join you.",Gemini
"Jun 17, 2022 - Enthusiasm and energy will be your allies today, Gemini. Something different is in the air and inciting you to move forward. You will make decisions and go in new directions for your own good and for the good of the people around you. Your dynamism will have a beneficial impact on your family. This newfound strength will give you a great boost.",Gemini
"Jun 18, 2022 - You were once a creature of reason, Gemini. For you, everything had an explanation, a reason to exist, and a place in the world. You never missed a chance to share your viewpoint. Then all of a sudden, silence. Perhaps you needed to get some perspective, not necessarily on the things you know, but on how you express that knowledge. Now words have come back into your life and your ideas are more moderate.",Gemini
"Jun 19, 2022 - Your calm will be put to the test today, Gemini. Try not to fall into this trap. You should try to show people that you're a thoughtful person and your past experiences have given you wisdom. You don't necessarily have to respond to aggression. However, you shouldn't forget about your own point of view. Try to assert yourself calmly and steadily.",Gemini
"Jun 20, 2022 - A project that you're rather excited about could require some intense solitary work today, Gemini. You might sometimes feel as if the walls are closing in on you, but you need to concentrate in order to get the best possible results. You'll also need to take occasional breaks to clear your head. Nonetheless, you're likely to be happy with what you've accomplished by the end of the day. Get busy.",Gemini
"Jun 21, 2022 - The fiery energy of the day is helping you press on with projects you have in the works. Set things in motion now, Gemini. Move out of the background and onto center stage. Your rocket is fueled and ready to take off. All you have to do now is ignite the engine. Use the power of your emotions to deliver a boost that will propel you to the stars.",Gemini
"Jun 22, 2022 - The general atmosphere of the day may seem too slow and stodgy for your tastes, Gemini. Try not to get bogged down in details. Try not to worry too much. You may find that it's difficult to get any enthusiasm out of people today. You might just want to sit back and take it easy. This is a good day to plan and reorganize. Honor your recent achievements and consolidate all that you've worked for.",Gemini
"Jun 23, 2022 - Be adventurous and strike out into new territory, Gemini. Be a pioneer. Work to make some new discoveries in the world. Today isn't a day to worry about consequences. It's a day to get things started. There is a great deal of fiery energy in the cosmos helping you in your quest for the new and fresh. Take the lead and try not to get thrown off course by leeches and party poopers.",Gemini
"Jun 24, 2022 - All continues to go well personally and professionally, Gemini. You're feeling strong and vigorous, but you might find that you're a bit vague today. Your mind may not have its usual acuity, and you could be easily distracted. This isn't a good day to start new projects. Try to concentrate on finishing up old tasks and tying up loose ends in order to make this a rewarding day.",Gemini
"Jun 25, 2022 - Too much work and the resulting pressure over the past few days could have you feeling too tired to do anything more, Gemini, although your optimism and enthusiasm are still intact. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're dragging a little toward the end of the day. You'll be able to recharge your batteries before tomorrow. In the evening, relax at home with a good book.",Gemini
"Jun 26, 2022 - Today there might be tension in the air with no discernible cause, Gemini. Family members could seem preoccupied with problems they can't quite define. Your natural inclination might be to try to cheer them up, but it probably won't work. Don't be too annoyed if they don't respond to your efforts. It isn't them. It's the planets. This is a great day to jog, do aerobics, or otherwise work off tension.",Gemini
"Jun 27, 2022 - Today may be tough for you, Gemini. It might seem like nothing is fitting into place. Could it be that you're trying to be someone you aren't? If things aren't working out, don't press the issue. You're better off waiting for a time when you feel more confident about who you are and where you're going. Have a cup of tea and relax. Releasing stress can free your energy for other uses.",Gemini
"Jun 28, 2022 - Today you might feel especially intellectually and creatively inspired, and you could discuss your ideas with others. The process of communication could open new doors in your mind and result in some fascinating insights concerning whatever you're pursuing at this time. Sometime in the course of your conversations, Gemini, don't be surprised if you find that one of your friends needs a sympathetic ear. Enjoy your day.",Gemini
"Jun 29, 2022 - Today might be a somewhat difficult day for you, Gemini. Instinctively, you'll want to escape the situation and explore your freedom, but something will be holding you back. Take care of the bills on your desk and deal with the mess in the bedroom. Clearing the physical space around you will help clear your mental space, too. You'll be footloose and fancy free soon enough.",Gemini
"Jun 30, 2022 - Issues may get a little heavier than you'd perhaps like today, Gemini. Your job is to infuse some amusement into the situation. Your powers of adaptability will be put to the test, as other people seem to be completely fixated on their opinions. Be extra conscious of how your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, are apt to be offended by careless, offhand remarks.",Gemini
"Feb 4, 2023 - Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Gemini, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.",Gemini
"Jul 1, 2022 - Yesterday's trajectory might run into a couple of snags today, Gemini. You could find that your dreamy nature conflicts with the planned and steady. This conflict of interests may be creating some tension that will be difficult to work with. Your emotions are apt to deceive you, so try not to get pulled off course by a passing whim. Try to keep your feelings well grounded.",Gemini
"Jul 2, 2022 - You might feel like you've come out of the dark and into the light today, Gemini. A weight has been lifted, but there's still a great deal of emotional drama that needs to work itself out. Go for a long walk this afternoon and increase your lung capacity. Get your heart rate up. You'll find that the more active you are, the better you'll be able to sort through your emotional trauma.",Gemini
"Jul 3, 2022 - Today will be like playing a game on your home field, Gemini. You have fans out there supporting you and you know the territory. Take advantage of the little things that you have going for you. There is a dramatic force at work that may be erratic but extremely powerful as long as you can maintain control. Stay focused on your goals. True happiness is only a small step away!",Gemini
"Jul 4, 2022 - Give your loved ones the attention they need today, Gemini. Don't let another day go by without saying you love them. Life is short and getting shorter with each passing day. Feel free to be confrontational about a serious issue that needs to be addressed. You're responsible for your own feelings. Don't play the role of the victim. You'll only experience more pain and resentment later.",Gemini
"Jul 5, 2022 - When faced with ten entrees on the menu, it might be hard for you to choose just one. Feel free to order two or more, Gemini. Don't let indecisiveness slow you down. At the same time, don't view it as something negative. The key for today is to go with the flow. Expand your dreams as far and wide as you wish. Have fun as long as you're willing to take full responsibility for your actions.",Gemini
"Jul 6, 2022 - You may find your brain buzzing around like a bee today, Gemini. This is good. There's a great deal of information that you need to process now. Have you been thinking about buying some new electronic equipment or small appliances for your home? Now is a great time to do some research on this project before you pull out your wallet. Use this day to gather facts.",Gemini
"Jul 7, 2022 - You should be able to evaluate your emotions from a very neutral, detached perspective today, Gemini. Use this opportunity to take action based on what you feel. Make sure your actions aren't reactionary and that you aren't simply acting rashly in response to someone else's hasty maneuvers. Think before you make any sudden moves. You'll be amazed at what incredible things can develop if you simply use your head a bit first.",Gemini
"Jul 8, 2022 - It could be hard for you to feel connected to anyone today, Gemini. You're probably better off keeping to yourself. If you're feeling sad or depressed, it's best to work through these feelings on your own. Other people aren't apt to be too sympathetic to your situation. You're better off sticking to your work in order to keep the demons out of your head.",Gemini
"Jul 9, 2022 - It's a terrific day for you, Gemini, one in which you'll find that your jovial approach to every situation is just what the doctor ordered. Spend time with children and enjoy their magical world. Spread your love and affection to the people around you. Make sure that the corners of people's mouths are turning up instead of down. A friendly attitude will take you far.",Gemini
"Jul 10, 2022 - Events taking place at churches, meditation centers, and other places with a spiritual orientation could draw you near, Gemini. You might want to attend a service or program at one of them, if possible. Don't be surprised if some profound insights come to you that shed some light on a current situation you might be dealing with. Write them down or you might forget them later.",Gemini
"Jul 11, 2022 - A good tactic for you today would be to convert your fears into motivation for positive action. There's a great deal of energy at your disposal, Gemini, so don't waste it. Be aware that this is one of those times in which the smallest comment or insult could set off a huge chain reaction of misinformation or battles. People are quite emotionally charged, so be careful where you step.",Gemini
"Jul 12, 2022 - Suddenly you've found your energy again. Your engine is oiled up and ready to go, Gemini. Put yourself in high gear and don't let anything stand in your way. If disagreements with others arise, try to keep focused on the lessons that come from the situation instead of dwelling on the negative aspects. Take things to a higher level and don't be afraid to suggest radical change.",Gemini
"Jul 13, 2022 - Recent developments have brought new interests into your life, Gemini. As a result, you might be seriously considering enrolling in a formal course of study in the future involving these subjects. If you really want to do this, it's definitely the right time to start planning. Others in your community might want to do the same, so a discussion on the subject might help. Books and magazines could also be useful.",Gemini
"Jul 14, 2022 - A female friend you haven't seen for a while could surprise you with a call. A lot of interesting news and useful information could be exchanged that benefits both of you. You may make a number of short journeys throughout the day, Gemini, as you have a lot that needs doing. A small increase in income could also be in the works. In the evening, rent a romantic video.",Gemini
"Jul 15, 2022 - An appealing new face could appear on the scene today, Gemini. This might lead to a new friendship, although this person could be charming enough to bring out your insecurities. Put these aside - you're looking great. Since your efficiency is at an all-time high, plan on taking advantage of that by dealing with some errands you've been postponing for quite some time.",Gemini
"Jul 16, 2022 - Because your tendency recently has been to brood over everything, Gemini, a day like this can't be anything but beneficial. It has been difficult for you to find material satisfaction of late, but today offers you a view into the world of the intangible and unreal. You may find it especially gratifying to participate in an artistic or religious activity.",Gemini
"Jul 17, 2022 - Some enlightening conversations could occur today with a partner, Gemini, possibly romantic, possibly career-related. New methods of operation could come to your attention, perhaps involving modern technology that could speed up the process and increase your income. Bear in mind that some of what you hear may not be feasible for a while. Other ideas may never be practicable. Remember to remain objective and check out the facts.",Gemini
"Jul 18, 2022 - Your sensual side is likely to show itself today, Gemini. You might find yourself viewing young folks in tight jeans more appreciatively than you usually do. Racy novels and movies might also suddenly seem appealing. Romantic encounters are intense and passionate, so make sure you allow plenty of time for them. Enjoy yourself!",Gemini
"Jul 19, 2022 - In general, your spirit is upbeat, freedom loving, and adventurous, Gemini. Today, however, you might find that it's a bit more intense and possibly somber, especially when it comes to romantic issues. This approach to matters of the heart isn't exactly your normal style, but you're apt to find that it's appropriate for your situation now. Make sure you have the right tools for the job at hand.",Gemini
"Jul 20, 2022 - Today your powers of persuasion are at an all-time high. This is a good day to ask for a raise or promote a new project. Your drive to gain recognition for your accomplishments may necessitate seeking the public eye, so if publicity is what you need, this is the day to go for it. Your observational skills are acute, as is your insight into others' feelings. This is definitely a good day to seek advancement.",Gemini
"Jul 21, 2022 - It may feel as if something or someone is trying to keep you from moving ahead with your ambitious goals and aggressive nature, Gemini. At first you may resent this ball and chain attached to your ankle, but on closer examination, you'll see that this hindrance is actually a help. For now it's serving as an important reminder to slow down and do more thinking and planning before taking action.",Gemini
"Jul 22, 2022 - You may have endless ideas streaming through your head but little patience to see any of them through to the end, Gemini. Perhaps you're so busy jumping from one thought to the next that you don't take any of them far enough to know whether or not they're worth pursuing. Write thoughts down as they come to you, and go over them later when your mind is in a quieter state.",Gemini
"Jul 23, 2022 - Don't get thrown off your path, Gemini. Focus inward and concentrate on the tasks at hand. This may not be the most lighthearted and jovial day, but one must always take the good with the bad. Use the sober, grounding tone of today's energy to get down to business and stay there. Work now, play later! Remember the story about the ant and the grasshopper. Now is the time to store provisions for the future.",Gemini
"Jul 24, 2022 - You may experience a transformation in your thinking. It's bound to affect every aspect of your life, Gemini. By always questioning, you work through difficult issues that require a constant reshuffling of viewpoints. Feel free to open yourself up to new ways of thinking as you dismiss old ways that no longer serve you. Now is a terrific time to consider a fresh wave of thought. You'll be exposed to a new way of truth.",Gemini
"Jul 25, 2022 - An unexpected opportunity to take a short trip could present itself today, Gemini. Hop on that boat or train and see where it goes. If you have no real reason to travel, make one up. You don't need one anyway. The point is that it's time to get away from your current surroundings and explore other ways of living. If the time isn't right for you to get out and travel, at least make a plan now for a trip later.",Gemini
"Jul 26, 2022 - Today is a very powerful day for you, Gemini. You may find yourself going to extremes in certain areas of your life, especially when it comes to your romantic nature. You could be pulled way over to one side and then to the other. At first you may give it your all and the next minute completely withdraw. Try to find a balance in this seesaw game.",Gemini
"Jul 27, 2022 - Get things out in the open today, Gemini. If someone seems to insult you, call them on it. Letting things fester inside only destroys your self-esteem. You'd also be in danger of losing the respect of others. This could very well be a situation in which everyone but you sees the truth. Try not to let this happen. Be bold and assertive, and don't let others pull the wool over your eyes.",Gemini
"Jul 28, 2022 - It's OK to be wrong, Gemini. If you know you've made a mistake, feel free to admit it. Don't let your ego stand in the way of progress. Others won't want to deal with you if you insist that what you're doing is right all the time when perhaps it isn't. Your mind may be a bit more fragile on a day like this, so try to be more sensitive and receptive than usual.",Gemini
"Jul 29, 2022 - Today is your day to become a hero, Gemini. You don't have to be dressed in fancy tights and a cape to make an important difference in someone's life. Step up to the plate even if it isn't your turn at bat. True heroes are the ones who are able to do what needs to be done when necessary, regardless of the circumstances.",Gemini
"Jul 30, 2022 - Much has happened recently, Gemini. Have you allowed enough time to process it? It's likely that big changes are brewing at home or work. Stay focused on the job at hand rather than fret about events over which you have no control. You may feel as if you're on a roller-coaster ride, but everything will settle down in a few days. Blink to adjust your eyes to the strange new light.",Gemini
"Jul 31, 2022 - Today's planetary configurations are pushing you to get some perspective on your life and the lives of people closest to you, Gemini. You must admit that you've been rather selfish lately. You aren't the center of the universe, so why do you sometimes act like you are? This is a day to make amends with friends and loved ones. They'll welcome you back with open arms.",Gemini
"Aug 1, 2022 - Don't worry about not being on the right path, Gemini, because you are. You seem to always be in the right place at the right time. There's no need to feel regret or shame about things that have happened in the past. Turn negative experiences into lessons for a better future. Even though you may not be able to change a certain situation, you can at least change your reaction to it.",Gemini
"Aug 2, 2022 - Slow down and take a more reserved, sensitive, and calculated approach to things today, Gemini, especially when it comes to matters involving love and beauty. You'll find a greater level of sensuality waiting for you when you're willing to open up the door even wider. Go after the object of your desire, but make sure that your approach is sensitive and disciplined.",Gemini
"Aug 3, 2022 - There may be a bit of opposition coming at you, Gemini. There's a light, airy feeling that's prevalent everywhere. This is definitely the kind of energy you can connect with today. There's a great deal of strength in numbers. Don't let anyone try to stand in your way. It could very well be that they are operating on incorrect information.",Gemini
"Aug 4, 2022 - Expected calls or deliveries may prove more trouble than they're worth, Gemini. You could get involved in endless games of phone tag, and deliveries might come when you're out. This can be avoided if you're prepared. Make sure everyone knows what you're expecting so they can watch for it. Tell people the best times to phone and be available at those times. Don't worry. You'll manage.",Gemini
"Aug 5, 2022 - Be passionate about the thing you love the most, Gemini. Instead of trying to eat every single thing at the buffet table, just pick one or two items that you like the best and eat them with great enjoyment. Feel free to take some for later. Don't let anyone talk you into a dish that doesn't appeal to you. You're the only one who knows what you truly hunger for.",Gemini
"Aug 6, 2022 - This is one of those days in which you're better able to stand back and look at your emotions intellectually, Gemini. Your freedom-loving nature isn't built to deal with heavy emotional baggage and turmoil, so don't bother trying. Be especially wary of those who seem to plop a problem in front of you and expect you to deal with it.",Gemini
"Aug 7, 2022 - Gemini, who's that intriguing new person in your neighborhood? What is it about this new neighbor that makes it impossible for you to stop wondering about them? Quit obsessing. Get your courage up and find a way to welcome him or her to the neighborhood. Maybe you'll find this person likable, maybe not, but give it a shot anyway. Enjoy.",Gemini
"Aug 8, 2022 - Emotions run high as disagreements turn into quarrels among members of a group you're affiliated with, Gemini. Stay out of it. It won't do you any good to get involved. Write your impressions and share them after tempers have cooled. You might want to make one final push toward reaching a personal goal, but forces beyond your control could block you. Try to remain patient.",Gemini
"Aug 9, 2022 - Someone who interests you could seem to be showing interest in someone else. This might arouse your insecurities and cause a bit of jealousy. Don't make yourself crazy, Gemini. All may not be as it seems. Try to discern the facts. Invitations to do more than one thing on the same night might force you to make an uncomfortable choice. Make the one that suits you best.",Gemini
"Aug 10, 2022 - An intense, emotional dream could move you so powerfully that you awaken with the odd sense that the dream was real. Write it down, Gemini. Maybe it is. Efforts to overcome obstacles and advance in business could finally pay off. You could walk around in a daze asking yourself if it really has happened. It has. Make the most of it, and don't be afraid to show your feelings.",Gemini
"Aug 11, 2022 - Group activities or social events in your neighborhood, if possible, could put you in touch with new and exciting people who eventually become friends, Gemini. Shared goals and interests could give rise to plans for ambitious projects. Whatever enterprises you start today are likely to prove successful if everyone involved pitches in. This evening, enjoy quiet time with your partner.",Gemini
"Aug 12, 2022 - A love partner may have heard some great career news today and want to take you out to celebrate, Gemini. Go - no matter what you have to reschedule. Your friend is in a great mood, looks wonderful, and is feeling very passionate and sexy. If you want a night to remember, don't let this chance pass you by. Also make sure you look your very best.",Gemini
"Aug 13, 2022 - Today you might wake up feeling that you can move mountains - and this might be exactly what you set out to do, figuratively speaking. Your physical energy, enthusiasm, and self-confidence are very high, Gemini. Your own and others' creative projects could take up a lot of your time. If you're coaching or helping others, however, avoid the temptation to take over the project.",Gemini
"Aug 14, 2022 - You have lots of energy and self-confidence, Gemini. That's wonderful, but it may also put you at greater risk for dangerous experiences and accidents. You could find that you're much more aggressive, especially if someone crosses you. An emotional irritation could manifest in physical ways like reckless driving or arguments with people who don't deserve your anger.",Gemini
"Aug 15, 2022 - Make some plans for recreation, Gemini. Having something fun to look forward to can make even the toughest times far easier to handle. You'll be amazed at how much you can manage when there's an end in sight. Your whole attitude lightens, so take the bull by the horns and create your own incentives. Do something special to reward yourself for the hard work you do every day.",Gemini
"Aug 16, 2022 - It won't be surprising if you're frustrated with a close friend or partner who's far less ambitious than you, Gemini. The energy in the air can emphasize your dynamic ways of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful may be difficult for you to understand. Yet people have to do things in ways that are best for them. Try to be patient.",Gemini
"Aug 17, 2022 - Welcome to another great day, Gemini! The energy from the planetary aspects is positive and encouraging, especially when it comes to communicating and interacting with others. Take advantage of this. Get together with friends and family for a pleasant visit, if possible. Consider inviting people over for games or dinner or do it virtually if need be. A potluck can be fun. You work hard all the time, so play gently today.",Gemini
"Aug 18, 2022 - Gemini, consider that artistic expression can happen in many ways. It isn't always about drawing a picture, singing a song, playing music, or acting. The way you arrange your home or workspace is an artistic expression, as are how you dress and do your hair. Each thing you do is an expression of your style. You are uniquely artistic. Enjoy this gift today.",Gemini
"Aug 19, 2022 - Follow your instincts, Gemini. Even if you tend to listen more to your reason, put that aside. While your ears can hear words, your intuition can hear what's between the lines and provide you with a much bigger picture. If something sounds right but feels wrong, you'll be better off trusting your feelings. Act with careful consideration and caution.",Gemini
"Aug 20, 2022 - Gemini, if there's something interesting that you've wanted to try, this is a great day for it. Adventure brings excitement, creative flow, and energy, which are essential to you.

"Aug 21, 2022 - The fire within you is raging today, Gemini, and you should be careful how you wield this power. Be proud and triumphant. Walk with your shoulders back and head high. Freedom is important, but make sure that others don't interpret it as you not caring about a person or situation that's actually quite meaningful to you. Let your heart speak openly and honestly.",Gemini
"Aug 22, 2022 - Today is your day, Gemini, so live it up! If it seems like things have been rather intense lately, don't worry, they're apt to lighten up quite a bit today. Feel free to be your usual jolly self, the one who adds humor to the group. Your laughter will be appreciated. Come into the forefront. Bring things up to your level and you'll find that others willingly join you there.",Gemini
"Aug 23, 2022 - Some new information about an interesting field could have you browsing the web and looking through books to learn more, Gemini. This could involve law, philosophy, history, or spirituality. You could find so much that you want to take notes or make a lot of photocopies. Don't tire yourself out and try to keep track of time. You might miss dinner or get to bed very late.",Gemini
"Aug 24, 2022 - Conversations with a friend whose good sense you trust could open your eyes to new career possibilities, Gemini. You might think about transforming your working life.

You'll probably be glad you did.",Gemini
"Aug 25, 2022 - Make sure that the battle you fight today is yours, Gemini. There's a great deal of tension in the air that might erupt when you least expect it.

Your philosophical viewpoint and strong spirit are the very combination needed to resolve the situation.",Gemini
"Aug 26, 2022 - A great deal of wind fills your sails today, Gemini, so set your course for a long-distance trip to an exotic place. Things are coming to a dramatic climax right now. You could find that some serious pieces of your life are taking a dramatic turn. Change is necessary for growth. If tension exists in certain areas of your life, don't fight it. Think about taking a different path.",Gemini
"Aug 27, 2022 - You're likely aware of your writing abilities, Gemini, but you may not realize the extent of your talent. It would be worthwhile to devote more time to your craft. You can't improve much if writing time is interrupted by other obligations. Take some time to produce something of value. Why not give it a try, even if just for a week or so, to see what you can do?",Gemini
"Aug 28, 2022 - You tend to be curious, Gemini, and you're always trying to learn more about your many interests. But today you could be eager to research a subject but be unable to find any information about it no matter how many libraries or databases you explore. Don't bother with it today. You'll only get frustrated. Watch some television. At least you'll get a few laughs.",Gemini
"Aug 29, 2022 - Happiness reigns in the home, Gemini, as everyone seems to have reached a new understanding of one another. You could also experience a new sense of peace and quiet. Everyone is concentrating more on reading and working on their own projects and less on socializing. This could be a wonderful time for you. You're getting along with your family and the house is a peaceful haven. Enjoy!",Gemini
"Aug 30, 2022 - You may be feeling a bit more in touch with your warrior side than your emotional side today, Gemini. More than likely this will set the stage for conflict in your world of hopes and dreams. Be careful that you aren't too aggressive toward people who are just trying to help you. The danger here is that you're most likely to hurt the ones closest to you. Be careful.",Gemini
"Aug 31, 2022 - If work is beginning to feel more like a burden than a joy, it may be time to rethink your job, Gemini. Your personality is such that you need lots of room to stretch and grow. If you feel stifled, you know it's time to find a new professional challenge. You're fortunate that your skill set affords you many opportunities. Choose carefully!",Gemini
"Sep 1, 2022 - Your emotions could feel restricted today, Gemini, a feeling that may be difficult to shake. Take this opportunity to calm down and relax. You'll enjoy the good times more when you give your body the rest it needs. Always pushing for bigger and better adventures may be fun, but it can leave you too tired to fully appreciate them.",Gemini
"Sep 2, 2022 - Money that you've been earning for a long time may finally come your way today, Gemini, but don't be surprised if you have to do a lot of running around in order to get it.

This is an excellent time to learn a new moneymaking skill.",Gemini
"Sep 3, 2022 - Valuable and interesting information could come your way through modern technology.

Online group activities may also be appealing now, particularly those regarding humanitarian pursuits.",Gemini
"Sep 4, 2022 - Your mood should be good today, Gemini, although you should be careful not to rub it in others' faces. If people don't feel like being cheerful, don't force it on them. An important sense of duty is prominent and should be obeyed at all costs.

"Sep 5, 2022 - You're spiritually inclined, Gemini, and today you could feel especially so. You might be attracted to online meditation groups or the study of the texts of various religions. You're also likely to feel especially psychic, and you might experience some premonitions that actually come true. This is a good time to train your psychic abilities or try reading runes or tarot cards.",Gemini
"Sep 6, 2022 - Interesting communications from friends could center on possible world developments or maybe some juicy gossip about people you know, Gemini. Enjoy yourself, but don't take everything you hear at face value. Much of it is less actual fact than the product of someone's fertile imagination. Short journeys in your area could bring news of upcoming changes in your community. Expect the unexpected!",Gemini
"Sep 7, 2022 - Your mind may be going a thousand miles an hour today. You might be inundated with new ideas and information that could cause mental overload. Write it all down if you can. You'll want to refer to it later. It might be advisable to then go out for a walk or other exercise. This intellectual overload could produce excess nervous energy that you'll need to work off.",Gemini
"Sep 8, 2022 - Matters regarding love and romance are in your favor today, Gemini. You'll find that love comes to you when you least expect it. There's a powerful creative force within you that will be most rewarding if you put it to use for some sort of artistic endeavor. A strong yet erratic urge may call you into action, so be ready to respond with your entire being.",Gemini
"Sep 9, 2022 - Don't be surprised if lots of people contact you today. Perhaps you're in the mood to gossip or neighbors have news of changes nearby. You should be brimming with energy, so you can handle it, but you might find it a bit unnerving if communication gets too hectic. It's best just to go with the flow and enjoy situations like this. You can think about what it all means later.",Gemini
"Sep 10, 2022 - The glass may look half empty, but only at first glance. Keep looking at it, or perhaps change the way you look at it, and you'll see that it indeed is half full. You may be experiencing some frustration. Computers could be down, or communication hindered in some way. Don't get stressed. See this as an ideal time to relax since you can't get any work done anyway.",Gemini
"Sep 11, 2022 - Communication with close friends and a romantic partner should be especially beneficial today, Gemini, since you're feeling more in touch with those close to you.

"Sep 12, 2022 - Today you might have a strange feeling that something is wrong, perhaps in the neighborhood or with a friend or relative.

There's probably nothing really wrong, but someone close to you may have just experienced a shock of some kind.",Gemini
"Sep 13, 2022 - Have you been thinking about relocating, Gemini? The siren song of distant states or exotic lands may play constantly in your ears.

You can decide once you have all the facts.",Gemini
"Sep 14, 2022 - Bask in the sunshine of today, Gemini. Focus on the positive aspects of your life and work to expand these energies. There's a great deal of opportunity open at this time.

Have faith that you'll succeed, and you will.",Gemini
"Sep 15, 2022 - Give people the benefit of the doubt, Gemini. Don't be so hasty in your actions, and take the time to think things through.

People will be particularly drawn to this side of you, especially tonight.",Gemini
"Sep 16, 2022 - Happiness reigns as you and your household embark on one or more projects that could make your home more cheerful, Gemini.

This is a good day to throw an impromptu party. Enjoy your day!",Gemini
"Sep 17, 2022 - Romance and creativity are the driving forces in your life today, Gemini. You might find that feelings for a special person provide lots of inspiration for creative projects. Your creative energy makes you that much more attractive to the one you love most. This could prove to be an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying day. Make the most of it!",Gemini
"Sep 18, 2022 - A rush of physical energy may hit you this morning, Gemini, and you could feel like you have no outlet for it.

Your friend will receive some valuable help with an important matter, and you'll be able to make use of all that vigor.",Gemini
"Sep 19, 2022 - You have lots of energy at your disposal today, Gemini, but it's erratic and powerful.

Embrace the new, fresh aspects of your life that ring true to your freedom-loving nature. Give your soul room to breathe as you take a long walk in nature this afternoon.",Gemini
"Sep 20, 2022 - Communication involving romance could come unexpectedly today, Gemini. You may get a loving message from a romantic partner, or you could hear of a wedding to take place in the future amongst your circle of friends. You could also read a love poem or romance novel or write something along the same lines yourself! Someone might also express affection to you. Don't be surprised. You deserve it!",Gemini
"Sep 21, 2022 - Too much rigorous exercise over the past few days might have you feeling a little sore and tired, Gemini. Your nerves may be on edge, and you could be more likely than usual to snap at those around you. Try to ease both nerves and muscle aches by soaking in a hot bath. Herbal tea might also help. Accept that you should take it easy today and then do it!",Gemini
"Sep 22, 2022 - If it's true that you reap what you sow, Gemini, you're in for a great harvest in the coming months. Your hard work and focus will start to pay off handsomely with promotions and raises just when you may have given up on being acknowledged for all you do. Hang on to your great energy, passion, and enthusiasm. Doors are about to open for you. Get ready to walk through them.",Gemini
"Sep 23, 2022 - A long but necessary phone call from a close friend or love partner could come at work today, Gemini. Matters of immediate concern need resolution.

"Sep 24, 2022 - A small gathering in your neighborhood could attract interesting people, Gemini, but you may feel a little under the weather and consider staying home.

It's up to you, of course, but enjoy the evening whatever you do.",Gemini
"Sep 25, 2022 - This could be a banner day, Gemini. Your spiritual and career goals come together so both are enhanced, and neither is compromised. It's a neat trick.

Don't discount any ideas presented to you, as one will contain the key to meshing two of the most important parts of your life.",Gemini
"Sep 26, 2022 - A walk through your neighborhood could put you in the middle of an unexpected, interesting event, Gemini. It may be a small public gathering or an impromptu get-together, like a protest. Whatever it is, you could be transfixed by it. Make mental notes and then write down your impressions later.",Gemini
"Sep 27, 2022 - You might have to play nurse today, Gemini. A love partner could claim to feel unwell, and you might expend a lot of energy trying to make your friend feel better. Don't overdo it. There may be psychological factors at work. Your friend could be jealous of the attention you've been giving family and friends. Be attentive, but within limits!",Gemini
"Sep 28, 2022 - You usually love to talk, Gemini, but right now you've probably reached your limit. You've attended a number of virtual gatherings and talked to a lot of people over the past week or so, and now you want to sit quietly at home.

"Sep 29, 2022 - This is a good day for financial matters, Gemini. With your credit cards maxed out, you may be thinking that your bank account isn't as healthy as it could be. But today you're likely to receive some news that indicates otherwise. You may get a windfall or discover that your portfolio is generating healthy returns. It's a good day for paperwork.",Gemini
"Sep 30, 2022 - This is a day made for fun and frivolity, Gemini, not one in which you're likely to get many of your chores done. Try as you might to focus on the task at hand, there are distractions everywhere you turn. Your email pals could be sending you jokes and notes, and your friends could be bugging you to join them for whatever type of outing is possible now. You may as well give in.",Gemini
"Feb 4, 2023 - Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Gemini, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.",Gemini
"Oct 1, 2022 - A small gathering of friends, relatives, and neighbors could take place in your neighborhood today, if possible, Gemini. You might run into a few old friends you haven't seen in a long time and enjoy catching up. A former romantic partner could also get in contact. Are you still interested? If so, pursue it. It might work this time! If you're no longer interested, perhaps you could now be friends. Think about it!",Gemini
"Oct 2, 2022 - Don't take no for an answer today, Gemini. Know what you believe in and stick with it. There's a distinct advantage to holding true to your inner nature.

""The more the merrier"" should be your motto.",Gemini
"Oct 3, 2022 - You may feel as if your smile is unwelcome today, Gemini. It may seem to you like there's some sort of gloom and doom to people's attitudes that makes them unwilling to accept any sort of good news. Don't let this stop you from maintaining your own cheerful state. It's important that you not probe too deeply into the reasons behind other people's behavior now.",Gemini
"Oct 4, 2022 - If you're having trouble tackling a giant problem, Gemini, don't get discouraged or overwhelmed. They key for you is to break things down into smaller chunks, analyze them, and figure out their role within the greater whole. You will find that by taking things one step at a time, any problem you encounter will be infinitely easier to overcome than you may have thought at first.",Gemini
"Oct 5, 2022 - An intense card, email, or phone call could come from a sibling or other relative today. Perhaps this is a good chance to patch up an old quarrel with this person, but don't be tempted to start another! Emotions are running high now, Gemini, and it wouldn't take much to set someone off. You might want to go out and do a little shopping but be careful. Traffic could be bad.",Gemini
"Oct 6, 2022 - You're apt to be somewhat fickle when it comes to love and romance right now, Gemini. The key for you now is freedom. The problem with this mindset is that it might be misinterpreted. Your partner may think you simply aren't interested in him or her anymore. Remind your partner that it's OK to love someone while also needing time and space to do things on your own.",Gemini
"Oct 7, 2022 - You might need to put on the brakes today when it comes to love and romance, Gemini. Don't think that this means you have to break off any sort relationship that's in the works but realize that you may need to take a more realistic approach to how you handle it. The problem is that you may be getting so caught up in the fantasy of things that you aren't tending to practicalities.",Gemini
"Oct 8, 2022 - Try not to think too much about what is ""supposed"" to happen next, Gemini. The truth of the matter is that things don't necessarily work out the way they're planned, so don't count on something that has no guarantee of coming to fruition. Stick to your own way of doing things and try not to get too hung up on the results. The key now is to enjoy the process.",Gemini
"Oct 9, 2022 - If you find that there's tension in a close relationship, you may get the feeling that this isn't the right partner for you, Gemini. Don't automatically assume that the problem lies in your partner. Difficult situations involving the need for love and affection are likely to emerge regardless of the situation or the company. Instead of running to the next person, take the time to work things out.",Gemini
"Oct 10, 2022 - Is a new neighbor moving in nearby, Gemini? This person could come from a very interesting locale, so you might want to get to know him or her. Don't expect to be able to do this today. This person may be in and out throughout the afternoon and too busy with settling in. Drop some cookies off some time over the next few days, however. You will be glad you did.",Gemini
"Oct 11, 2022 - Stimulating conversations could take place with partners of all sorts, Gemini, from business to exercise to romantic. Some new and useful information could come your way that you will want to explore further. This is a great day to execute legal papers or enter into any kind of agreement or commitment. It's a good time to sign up for an online class or workshop. Make good use of the energies of the day.",Gemini
"Oct 12, 2022 - You should be looking especially attractive today and glowing with robust health, Gemini. You're apt to feel warm and loving, particularly toward small animals. If you've considered adopting a pet, this is a good day to do it. Business, work, and money matters continue to go well. You should be in a pretty good space. This frame of mind should last you a long time.",Gemini
"Oct 13, 2022 - Whatever you're working on at the moment, Gemini, whether business related, personal projects, or volunteer work, it's likely to bring you increased satisfaction on many levels. You're enjoying what you do, making a difference, and interacting with new friends. Your health continues to glow. You may feel as if nothing can stop you. Watch out for minor upsets, but nothing that will burst your bubble.",Gemini
"Oct 14, 2022 - Perhaps you've been impatiently waiting for the moment to jump into new adventures after your meditation during the last few months. Know that the moment has almost arrived! You now have the strategy, objective, and means at your disposal to succeed. Just a bit more work remains to be done. Gather your strength and get ready to act with renewed vigor.",Gemini
"Oct 15, 2022 - Your financial situation could be greatly boosted by a development you hadn't expected, Gemini. Perhaps some investments suddenly skyrocket in value, or maybe the homes in your neighborhood are suddenly worth more than you thought. Whichever it is, don't try to cash in on it right now. Chances are the value of your investment will continue to increase. Hang in there and watch it grow.",Gemini
"Oct 16, 2022 - Grab hold of the day's boisterous energy and run with it, Gemini. This is a good time to kick up your heels and have fun. You might find that people are a bit more high-strung than usual, so you may need to use your ability to go with the flow. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed others will be when they're around you.",Gemini
"Oct 17, 2022 - You might consider taking a short trip today, Gemini. Perhaps you need to get out of the house and go across town. Whatever it is, introduce your brain to a new reality. It's time to expand and explore. You itch to see new places and experience new things, either physically or mentally. Perhaps a religious sanctuary or quiet place in grove of trees is what you need in order to quench this inner thirst.",Gemini
"Oct 18, 2022 - Peace and harmony are in the regularly scheduled program for the day, but there is a good chance that there could be a warring force with strong opinions and vindictive tendencies. Hold onto your hat, Gemini, and make sure you have your actions well aligned with your soul or else you could be thrown into a battle that has nothing to do with you.",Gemini
"Oct 19, 2022 - Indecisiveness could be your biggest nemesis today, Gemini. The general tone of the day is apt to be quite explosive as a feeling of restriction and discipline comes into conflict with a need to fight and conquer. You might find that your go-with-the-flow, easygoing attitude is exactly what saves you on a day like this. Lay low and let someone else take the lead now.",Gemini
"Oct 20, 2022 - You may still be on something of a high from the last couple weeks. You will definitely be tempted to let the good times continue to roll, Gemini. Think about ways you can keep them rolling while still maintaining good judgment. Don't let things get too out of control today. It's important that you maintain a bit of stability at all times.",Gemini
"Oct 21, 2022 - A small spark in a dry field is apt to whip the hill into flames, Gemini. A raging wildfire may be underway by the end of the day. Know that you're one of the biggest perpetrators, but don't feel badly about it. Fire is destructive but also necessary. Clearing out brush and offering a fresh new place in which new growth can flourish is an important part of the cycle of nature.",Gemini
"Oct 22, 2022 - You don't normally tend toward frugality, Gemini, but today you could go overboard with your spending. Frustration from all sides makes you want to release it all at once by acquiring new possessions. This is fine up to a point. Treat yourself but take care that you curb the impulse buying. You don't want to waste any time tomorrow taking unwanted items back to the store.",Gemini
"Oct 23, 2022 - Are you doing something special for the people you live with tonight, Gemini? If so, you might be a little worried about what they might think of your skills as a chef, host, etc. Don't waste any time worrying. A good time will be had by all, including you. Everyone is likely to have a memorable evening. Just do your best, be your usual jovial self, and concentrate on having fun.",Gemini
"Oct 24, 2022 - Short journeys in your neighborhood, perhaps connected with a group you're associated with, could take up a lot of your time today, Gemini. Fascinating and stimulating emails or calls could arrive. Books and magazine articles could provide information that sends you in a new direction in some way. Write down your ideas! You will want to remember them all.",Gemini
"Oct 25, 2022 - This could be a confusing day for you, Gemini. Financial issues might be complicated by computer glitches or failures in communication. Keep pushing, however, and whatever you're trying to straighten out will be resolved. An opportunity to participate in a project you've never tried before could have you doubting your abilities. Believe in yourself and then move ahead. There's a first time for everything!",Gemini
"Oct 26, 2022 - This isn't the day to plan a trip by air, Gemini. Everything that can go wrong with such a trip will - delays, lost luggage, obnoxious seatmates. If you have one planned for today, change it to a future date if possible. This also isn't a good day to take an online class, since your attention span could be unusually short. What can you do? Relax, read, surf the Internet. A lot of interesting information could spark your curiosity.",Gemini
"Oct 27, 2022 - You may have been expecting some money over the past several days, and today it could finally arrive. Delays in reaching your goals are finished for the moment. If you have a project you've been trying to complete, Gemini, this is the day to do it, especially if it involves paperwork. This isn't the day to compete with anyone, however. Your sense of cooperation is too strong.",Gemini
"Oct 28, 2022 - You might wake up this morning and decide your home is a total wreck. The desire to spend the day cleaning and sprucing up your house might prove almost obsessive. Do what you have to do, but don't get so caught up that you forget about the big picture. Whatever you do today, Gemini, view it in its proper perspective. The world won't end if your house isn't flawlessly clean.",Gemini
"Oct 29, 2022 - Your time finally seems to be your own, Gemini. There are probably no rush jobs to finish, no urgent phone calls to make, and no one looking over your shoulder. This causes a significant release of stress, and you're better able than usual to focus on what you have in front of you. In the evening, relax at home, order delivery, and watch a movie.",Gemini
"Oct 30, 2022 - You may have to make an important decision today, Gemini. It has come to the point where someone draws a line in the sand and challenges you to cross it. Do you stay where you are and continue on without that person, or do you join them and support their goals and actions? The conflict today is between your head and your gut. Don't limit your choices to two. There are always compromises.",Gemini
"Oct 31, 2022 - Climactic events are apt to occur in your life, Gemini. It's time to condense and solidify your grand schemes and bright ideas in such a way that makes them more practical. Things may be spinning so quickly that you aren't quite sure where to jump on. Worry about that later. For now, what you need to do is express your ideas forcefully and succinctly. Doors will open as a result.",Gemini
"Nov 1, 2022 - You may be like a giant trying to befriend a small bug, Gemini. You have absolutely nothing in common and don't even speak the same language. With one accidental move, you could easily squash that little bug. This isn't to say that you can't learn to become best friends. Just know that this kind of relationship is going to take some work.",Gemini
"Nov 2, 2022 - Gemini, check your house to make certain everything is in working order. There are indications that small hazards could exist that need correcting. Tension might run high among family members, and quarrels could result. Don't waste time trying to mediate. They will have to work it out for themselves. This is a great day for study and solitude since your mind is especially sharp.",Gemini
"Nov 3, 2022 - Gemini, you see new horizons. It's possible that the changes you've been going through lately aren't completely finished. You may even have a hard time keeping yourself from running away from it all. Your rebirth will only be complete after you clearly define your desires. Use today to think about what you want. Things aren't completely clear.",Gemini
"Nov 4, 2022 - Today's planetary configurations indicate that this would be a good moment to get rid of everything that's still holding you back from an impending rebirth, Gemini. One stumbling block for you may be the impulse that you seem to have to blend in with others. You're an individual, Gemini. This isn't something to overcome. It should be celebrated!",Gemini
"Nov 5, 2022 - Today is well suited for making new friends, Gemini. Your sense of adventure is undoubtedly up to it! You will be your usual confident self, but others will seem to respond to your charisma even more than usual. If you’re able to attend a small party, you may meet someone who lives far away who invites you to visit at a later date. What a wonderful opportunity for travel!",Gemini
"Nov 6, 2022 - If you knew the truth of all the things that are going on outside your world, you'd be appalled, Gemini. You shouldn't take things at face value today. It's important to simply go and see things for yourself. Don't trust another's word on what is true and what isn't. Question what you see. Make sure you don't let others pull the wool over your eyes.",Gemini
"Nov 7, 2022 - Today is going to be a great day for you, Gemini. You aren't one to embrace rules, constraints, or restrictions of any kind, preferring instead to reside in a fantasy world where no limitations apply. Have you considered that it's possible for you to join the rest of us here on Earth and still retain your liberty and ideals?",Gemini
"Nov 8, 2022 - It isn't because your new projects demand such precision that they're causing you problems, Gemini. You tend to think details keep you from having a global vision, but that simply isn't true. There's no conflict between the long-term view and short-term needs. You just think that the latter gets in the way of the former. Try thinking of the details that you find annoying as steppingstones to your larger vision.",Gemini
"Nov 9, 2022 - You're wasting your energy, Gemini, and you know it. You try your best to go about your everyday routine, but you're never really present. You listen to people but what they're saying doesn't interest you in any fundamental way. Yes, you're bored, and you're afraid to admit it to yourself. The depth of your inner search requires that you use a lot of energy to reexamine your life.",Gemini
"Nov 10, 2022 - Today could be rather constraining, Gemini. Despite your great aspirations, today will be marked by the need to take care of the small problems that arise in everyday life. In other words, just what you love. That said, being more down to Earth or in contact with the realities of the world can never do anything but good for you.",Gemini
"Nov 11, 2022 - Your spirit sparkles, Gemini. You may feel filled with tremendous energy as you go about your day. Your sense of adventure is high, and there's very little that gets you down. One area that might be difficult to deal with right now is love and romance. You may feel like this is the one domain in which things aren't going the way you'd like them to. Patience is the secret.",Gemini
"Nov 12, 2022 - You may have had a hard time lately reaching your objectives. Unfortunately for you, Gemini, today will be no different. You may begin to feel a bit dissatisfied with the way your life is going at the moment. You will ask yourself certain questions about your goals. Does your personal life live up to those goals? Can you express your wonderful creativity as much as you'd like?",Gemini
"Nov 13, 2022 - Obstacles that you encountered in attaining your cherished goals could suddenly seem to melt away, clearing the way to make your dreams come true, Gemini. This could involve physical health, plans for future travel and education, and self-expression. You could also feel especially passionate now, so a romantic evening with that special someone would be particularly enjoyable. You feel great, so look your best, too!",Gemini
"Nov 14, 2022 - Errands or other short journeys in your neighborhood could result in a chance meeting with someone who could be of great benefit to you in the future, Gemini. Opportunities to advance your educational, artistic, or spiritual interests could open up as a result of this meeting. When you go out, make sure you look your best even if you're only going to the grocery store.",Gemini
"Nov 15, 2022 - It's good to dream, especially on days like today, Gemini. Expanding your mind and thinking of possibilities are positive ways to increase your knowledge. Give yourself time to think. Why not lie on your back and watch the clouds or stars? Let yourself dream about things that may not seem practical or possible. Many real things have come out of someone's dreams. Your creativity will flourish if you take the time.",Gemini
"Nov 16, 2022 - Consider planning a romantic interlude, Gemini. With the influence from today's planetary aspects, it will be easy to connect with that special someone. Make dinner with your spouse or partner or make a date with someone new who's caught your eye, if possible. Don't let shyness or insecurity stand in your way. If you're single, consider loving the most important person in your life - you - by doing something special.",Gemini
"Nov 17, 2022 - You've reached a climactic time of year regarding love and romance, Gemini. This is the time when your dream finally materializes, or you realize that all your efforts are failures. It all depends on how you played your cards over the past few months. This is one of those moments of reckoning when you face reality. You must bring your craft to the landing strip and check in with mission control.",Gemini
"Nov 18, 2022 - Your surroundings are currently changing, Gemini. Perhaps your circle of friends has already undergone a major change. The fact is that you no longer have so many prejudices about the people you meet, and no longer seek only a certain type of person as a friend. You accept whoever comes along. You may not realize it, but your attitude is completely different now than it once was. Good for you!",Gemini
"Nov 19, 2022 - The day ahead won't be easy, Gemini. A glimpse at your love life reveals that you will be bridling at certain inhibitions. You long for peace and stability, and at the moment everything is in suspense. Use the day ahead to gain some perspective on the situation. Until the ice melts and the flow of events resumes, why not devote your energy to some other endeavor?",Gemini
"Nov 20, 2022 - You have a promising day ahead, Gemini. Finally, you will advance by leaps and bounds in whatever needs to be done. Whatever has been causing the delays will likely be revealed today. You return to the skill and professionalism you so value after several weeks of halting progress. Don't tolerate any violation of your ethics now or in the future.",Gemini
"Nov 21, 2022 - Vast amounts of information could come to you through email or phone. Expect to hear from groups. You could make new friends, Gemini, possibly in your neighborhood, as changes could be taking place in your community. You could hear of online classes you want to take. Books or magazines may bring valuable information. This could be a very stimulating and significant day.",Gemini
"Nov 22, 2022 - The social agitation that has been in your life for the last three weeks is coming to an end, Gemini. The celestial energy will help you learn some lessons and prepare for the next cycle. It would be great if you had some success and honors because this would help you confront the coming weeks. It will be a time of meditation and feeling a little bit disconnected from the world.",Gemini
"Nov 23, 2022 - Your playful attitude is apt to be opposed by someone who refuses to see things your way, Gemini. Walk away from those who aren't committed to helping the situation. It could be that there are people who purposefully try to sabotage your plans. You're too smart to fall into this trap. Prove to others that even though you may be happy, it doesn't mean you're gullible.",Gemini
"Nov 24, 2022 - You might be distracted by daydreams of a trip you're planning to take, Gemini. A friend could phone and want to discuss it, which doesn't help. Visions of faraway places and exciting pastimes may dance in your head, and routine tasks seem incredibly tedious and unworthy of attention. It's best to get them done if you can. Then you can fantasize about your vacation without guilt!",Gemini
"Nov 25, 2022 - Move in for the touchdown today, Gemini, and don't stop until you succeed. Don't let other people's insecurities become yours. Have confidence in yourself and the way you behave around others. Just because someone else feels sad doesn't mean you have to, just to make them feel better. The best thing you can do in this situation is turn it around by exhibiting sheer happiness.",Gemini
"Nov 26, 2022 - Devote the day to your children or partner, Gemini. You may protest that it's too hard to find the time to give them the attention they deserve. You don't have time for yourself, much less anyone else. In any case, you will probably feel torn between what is expected of you and what you feel you can realistically give. If you want to dispel the inner tension, take care in the choices you make in the next few weeks.",Gemini
"Nov 27, 2022 - All dissatisfaction will be abolished today as you systematically confront and resolve all the little problems that have been bothering you. Your tolerance threshold is low to nonexistent. Give a wide berth to friends who have been irritating lately. Your wardrobe improves dramatically as you discard all those clothes that don't fit or no longer suit you.",Gemini
"Nov 28, 2022 - Communication with others could be extremely rewarding, Gemini, especially later in the day. Project more of your energy outward and join others in projects that you might otherwise try to tackle on your own. Things should flow smoothly as long as you take a lighthearted, optimistic approach. Move forward with projects instead of just contemplating their completion.",Gemini
"Nov 29, 2022 - Your heart is in the right place today, Gemini, so feel free to share your good mood with others. Keep things simple and straightforward. Try not to complicate issues with unnecessary garble. Streamline your thoughts and actions. You will find that you can be much more efficient when you cut out the aspects that aren't pertinent or absolutely necessary. Follow your heart.",Gemini
"Nov 30, 2022 - You've been stamping the ground impatiently. You're waiting for the moment to jump into new adventures with renewed vigor after your meditation of the last few months. Gemini, know that the moment has almost arrived! You now have the strategy, objective, and means at your disposal to succeed. Just a bit more work remains. Gather your strength and get ready for action!",Gemini
"Feb 4, 2023 - Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Gemini, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.",Gemini
"Dec 1, 2022 - Today, Gemini, you might uncharacteristically decide to sequester yourself away from the world. Perhaps you're tired or feeling a bit under the weather and only wish to kick back and read a good book. That's fine. Everyone needs a little solitude from time to time. The only concern here is that if you stay too secluded, you might miss an important communication. Resist the temptation to turn off the phone!",Gemini
"Dec 2, 2022 - Things should be going well for you today, so don't miss the opportunities that await you, Gemini. There's a sparkle in your eye that's unmistakable, and you will find that issues regarding love and romance are especially potent. Love is on your side. You should take this opportunity to delve deeply into a love affair. Take a trip with the people you enjoy most.",Gemini
"Dec 3, 2022 - Things coming at you from all sides are forcing you to make a move, Gemini. Try not to feel pressured into something you don't want to do. A nervous restlessness is apt to take over your being and urge you to act. Don't let other people's energies dictate your actions. Secure your position and be strong. Don't be lured into situations you know are bad for you.",Gemini
"Dec 4, 2022 - Balance your boisterous, adventurous nature with a bit of discipline today, Gemini. It's important to laugh, but it's also important to stay on task with your duties. The good news is that both of these things can work in tandem. They aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, one will help you achieve the other. Be serious but have a good time and keep things in perspective.",Gemini
"Dec 5, 2022 - You can soar to great heights on a moment's notice today, Gemini. There's a fast-paced, socially minded quality to the day that will encourage people to share more of themselves with others. You will find a great deal of support from many different people now. Welcome this help with open arms. Don't try to do things by yourself when you're surrounded by such a strong team spirit.",Gemini
"Dec 6, 2022 - Because you tend to brood over everything right now, Gemini, a day like this can't be anything but beneficial. It has been difficult for you to find satisfaction within the realm of the known world lately, but today offers you a journey into another perception, one that's intangible and unreal. You may find it gratifying, especially if you try some artistic, esoteric, or religious activity.",Gemini
"Dec 7, 2022 - You must be wondering what in the world is going on? On the one hand, you have humanistic and harmonious thoughts about your family and work environment. On the other hand, you also have a deep desire to destroy everything in order to start fresh! You will have to choose. In any case, given the current climate and the fire inside you, any sort of compromise will prove difficult. Don't go overboard!",Gemini
"Dec 8, 2022 - There is more than meets the eye to a money situation today, Gemini. There could be errors in your financial records, or someone may not be telling the truth about an important item. You're a caring, trusting person, but this isn't the day to blindly accept anyone's statements. Check the facts and see for yourself, then act accordingly in order to see to your own best interests.",Gemini
"Dec 9, 2022 - An attractive neighbor with whom you seem to share a bond could become a friend. A group you're affiliated with could be expressing highly idealized goals and purposes. These goals are likely to be admirable, Gemini, but they may not be all that realistic. Bear that in mind before committing to any course of action. You need more facts before you can proceed.",Gemini
"Dec 10, 2022 - Today you might need to run a lot of errands, Gemini. This could prove frustrating. Traffic could be bad, you might not find what you need, and it may be difficult to reach those you need to consult. These are all circumstances beyond your control, so it's best to find something else to do. This is a great day to stay in and research matters that you may want to put to use.",Gemini
"Dec 11, 2022 - There's a great deal of grounding energy in your world today, Gemini, which might work to smother your fire. Whatever happens, don't let the embers burn out. One of the assets you bring to the group is a strong dynamism that gives people the courage to change. Be a fighter in the ring. Remember that at the end of the day, you need only be satisfied with the performance of one person - you.",Gemini
"Dec 12, 2022 - Don't criticize the situation until you've come up with a better solution, Gemini. Be creative. You can accomplish much if you approach the situation confidently. Pessimism won't help find a solution. Relax and let your intuition guide you. Feel free to speak with confidence and strength. Perhaps the most fanciful-sounding answers will be the most ingenious solutions.",Gemini
"Dec 13, 2022 - Things should go well for you today, Gemini. Your romantic nature is piqued. You will find that an aggressive approach toward your loved one is just what's needed to jump-start the relationship. If you're single and looking for love, this is a good day to make first contact with a crush. Neaten up your appearance and wear a snazzy outfit, regardless of the situation.",Gemini
"Dec 14, 2022 - Today is a terrific day for you, Gemini, in which action spells reward. You can't go wrong by expressing your needs and how they fit with the collective agenda. Feel free to focus on you and be selfish about your passions. Be aware that unexpected events may crop up to remind you that number one is indeed important, but don't forget about numbers two, three, and so on.",Gemini
"Dec 15, 2022 - Today may be a rough day in which you find it hard to decide about anything. Refrain from making any major moves regarding finances or real estate. Concentrate on you and the answers will come from within. Be realistic and practical when it comes to your emotions. You may find it hard to connect with someone tonight, so stick close to home and focus inward.",Gemini
"Dec 16, 2022 - Take care of your home today, both physically and emotionally. See that bills are paid, and the bedroom is tidy. Don't forget to clean the dust from under your bed and the demons from inside your mind. Realize that you might be running on someone else's operating system that got stuck in your hard drive. Make sure you replace it with your own software before you continue.",Gemini
"Dec 17, 2022 - Today is a fantastic day for you, Gemini. You should enjoy a good mood and positive experiences with others. There's most likely a slow-moving, transforming energy in your life right now that's touching off your emotions. You will find that there is a great deal of fire and passion fueling your heart, so be generous with your kind spirit and follow through with your promises.",Gemini
"Dec 18, 2022 - You have the gift of being able to get your great ideas across to others. In your family, you may be the one who teaches your children about life and its responsibilities. Today someone might teach you something you didn't know. You should never forget that education means communication, and communication is the exchange of ideas.",Gemini
"Dec 19, 2022 - Think long and hard before making commitments, Gemini. Much is at stake, especially where your love life is concerned. It's likely that a proposal is coming your way. Do you know how you will answer? Events may have you feeling like you're at a crossroads when actually you're more on track than ever. The key lies in trusting your instincts and remaining true to your ideals.",Gemini
"Dec 20, 2022 - You like to give people advice and help them find direction in their lives - sometimes when they haven't even asked. But now it's your turn to feel a little lost. You may need to get away from it all to get some perspective on your life. What about taking a trip to some faraway land? Today is a good day to make your future vacation plans.",Gemini
"Dec 21, 2022 - Things may seem a little cloudy today, Gemini, but this is no reason to be blue. It could be that you need to adjust before you can smoothly relate to others. Take this opportunity to attend to things that you normally wouldn't think of. See things from the perspective of someone in another walk of life. Realize the fun of just staying home and falling asleep on the couch.",Gemini
"Dec 22, 2022 - It might seem like someone has dumped a bucket of water on your head today, Gemini. It seems like your fire is out. Keep in mind that this is only temporary and that your internal flame will be rekindled soon. For now, you may want to take this time to slow down and relax. Use this as an opportunity to reflect and tune in to your sensitive, caring nature. Let someone else take the reins.",Gemini
"Dec 23, 2022 - You're so upbeat and optimistic by nature that it's difficult for you to accept certain failures. That may be what you're thinking today as you reflect on recent humanitarian efforts. Try not to take such a short-sighted attitude. You're making a difference, even though it may not always be apparent. Continue on this path. Ultimately, you will see how worthwhile the journey is.",Gemini
"Dec 24, 2022 - It's time to loosen up, Gemini. The planetary aspects bring a new cycle of tolerance and understanding your way. You could use a bit of both. Take baby steps as you introduce the kinder, gentler you to your friends and co-workers. They won't accept a rapid transformation, but they won't mind gradual changes. Listen more and speak less. This can make a big difference in a relationship.",Gemini
"Dec 25, 2022 - Take a step back from the line of fire today and examine your position. You've made some bold moves and now it's time to pause and evaluate. Listen to others' reactions. Take the observations and comments to heart. Other people may see things about your situation that you don't. Don't get boxed in by narrow-minded thinking. Digest what you learn and expand your horizons.",Gemini
"Dec 26, 2022 - Your playful attitude will be a welcome addition to the sober, restrictive tone of the day. On the other hand, it may behoove you to be serious in order to accomplish what you need to get done. The choice is up to you. However, you would probably be wise to spend this day taking care of chores and nagging errands that you've put off for quite some time.",Gemini
"Dec 27, 2022 - What an extraordinary day for you, Gemini! The dynamic energy in the air will help you set new personal goals. The positive feedback you get from the people around you could inspire you to make some life-changing decisions for the good of you and your family. Don't hesitate to share the day's positive attitude with them.",Gemini
"Dec 28, 2022 - You tend to want to explain everything that goes on around you, Gemini. You rationalize everything in an instant, and group all your experiences into great theories. But you've been very quiet for quite some time now. It's as if something is keeping you from speaking. Today you will get a few words in, so don't worry.",Gemini
"Dec 29, 2022 - Do you help the world evolve, Gemini? You may ask yourself this kind of delicate question today. Even if you're a person of action who knows how to react to situations, you should be careful not to be too impulsive. You have a specific role to play. Don't get thrown off track by emotional circumstances.",Gemini
"Dec 30, 2022 - You might find that others' strong opinions dictate today's actions, Gemini. The atmosphere is quite intense, so you might want to lay low and let others have their way. Don't try to put up a fight. Unexpected opposition may come out of nowhere and take control. There's a powerful force at work asking you to do things with more passion than usual.",Gemini
"Dec 31, 2022 - You may have many irons in the fire today, Gemini. People and projects could demand your attention, yet you may feel so dreamy and unmotivated that it could be hard to make progress on any of them. Creative solutions are the best route for you. Be flexible and open to other people's ideas, and make sure you consider the unlikeliest ways to tackle the issues.",Gemini
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2022 - See about using your good relationships with friends and loved ones today to get some group activities going, Cancer. Chances are you'll feel pretty good and the idea of socializing will appeal to you. See about inviting people over for supper or a game of cards. If you're especially lively, some sports may be just the ticket to get you out and moving. Do whatever it takes to have some fun and get some fresh air today.",Cancer
"Feb 5, 2022 - You might find yourself really interested in getting out and doing something today, Cancer. And why not? It can’t be too difficult to phone a few friends and arrange to get together in the evening. Or perhaps you can look in the events page in your local newspaper and see whether a meeting or lecture is taking place that you'd like to attend. Is there a place you've been curious about and wanted to visit? If so, go there today and check it out. Make the best of your time!",Cancer
"Feb 6, 2022 - Make some plans to write a letter, send a greeting card, or put together a package for someone far away today, Cancer. This can be a lot of fun to do, especially if the person on the receiving end isn't expecting anything from you. Pictures, crafts, cookies, candies, or books can make a wonderful package to send to someone special. Even a simple greeting card can really brighten someone's day. Have some fun.",Cancer
"Feb 7, 2022 - Is there a person in your life who keeps coming to mind again and again, Cancer? If so, it might be time to get together. Whether there's something that needs to be worked out or you simply miss him or her, take the steps needed to connect, even if it takes email, letters, or a phone call to get in touch. Rather than having them pop into your head continuously, reach out and make contact.",Cancer
"Feb 8, 2022 - Taking the easy way out won't tempt you in the least today, Cancer. This isn’t to say that you usually favor this approach, by any means; yet it's safe to say that everyone is tempted from time to time. Not so for you, though, as the planetary aspects are giving you the strength to take all of the necessary steps, however long they may be. Stand your ground if a partner tries to convince you otherwise.",Cancer
"Feb 9, 2022 - A number of new people could come your way, Cancer, perhaps through projects of some kind with which you're involved. Some of them may appear to be trustworthy and some may not. Today, however, your instincts are highly attuned and you'll be better than usual at sizing up people you don't really know. Make the most of this ability, and don't let logic get in its way. Follow your heart!",Cancer
"Feb 10, 2022 - Successes have been coming your way continually for a while, Cancer. The downside is that excessive celebrating and overindulging in food and drink could have you feeling physically out of sorts today. Nonetheless, your mood should still be very high, and you should still be strongly motivated to continue whatever it is you've been doing that has brought such positive results. Let your imagination flow freely, and keep on going.",Cancer
"Feb 11, 2022 - Legal documents that concern your business may need to be executed today, Cancer. There might be a lot of paper to wade through, not to mention jargon that appears indecipherable. Don't get too impatient, however, as this is important. Instead, find someone more familiar with this sort of thing and get him or her to explain it all to you. Then, assuming it's agreeable, take care of it and move on. The results should be well worth it!",Cancer
"Feb 12, 2022 - Careful planning on your part is starting to pay off, Cancer, but be careful that you don't alienate others in your quest to be the best. You may not realize how your harsh words affect the people around you. Be more sensitive to the feelings of others. Focus and be brave in your actions. Hesitation may cause you to lose control of the situation. Know your boundaries, but push beyond them.",Cancer
"Feb 13, 2022 - Machines involved in financial transactions, such as ATMs, phone systems, or banking websites could malfunction today, Cancer, so you might have to resort to dealing with money in the old fashioned way: by going into the bank or writing checks. Electrical storms or solar flares could be interfering with satellite signals, so there isn’t much you can do. Needless to say, this isn’t a good day to make any major financial transactions.",Cancer
"Feb 14, 2022 - Some rather boring and mundane tasks, perhaps involving paperwork, could take up much of your time today, Cancer. You could get easily distracted and be tempted to set it aside and do something more interesting, but don't fall into this trap. You'll want your recent pattern of success to continue, and so it's best to get the boring stuff out of the way and then move on to what's exciting. Hang in there!",Cancer
"Feb 15, 2022 - You could well be bubbling over with physical energy today, Cancer. You might want to spend your day visiting with friends. You could pick up some interesting information from them, which you might be able to put to work for you. You could lay plans for finally attaining a long-term goal; perhaps a lucky break made this possible. Expect to spend most of your day talking and planning!",Cancer
"Feb 16, 2022 - The desire to go off by yourself and enjoy a little solitude is likely to be in conflict with the reality of your obligations today, Cancer. You could find yourself spacing out at times and unable to concentrate on any tasks at hand, so try to stay focused. Some irritating letters or phone calls could come your way, but nothing that you can't deal with. See an exciting movie tonight.",Cancer
"Feb 17, 2022 - You’re usually a very practical and down-to-Earth person, but today you may be more inclined than usual toward mysticism. Spiritual matters seem extremely appealing, and you could find yourself gravitating toward metaphysical bookstores or seeking discussions with people who are well versed in such matters. You also find your imagination working overtime. Indulge in a few flights of fancy, Cancer. We all need to escape from time to time!",Cancer
"Feb 18, 2022 - A social event could put you in touch with someone who's carrying around a lot of bitterness and anger, Cancer. This probably won't be very pleasant for you, as this person could well see you as the perfect listening post for all their problems. Don't feel trapped! Be polite but make your excuses as soon as you can. There are other friends present whose company you'll enjoy a lot more!",Cancer
"Feb 19, 2022 - Emotional issues rooted in the past could leave you feeling inhibited today, Cancer. You might also be a bit more touchy than usual and see insult where none is intended. Curb the impulse to take offense. Try to confront and release the old issues or at least promise yourself you'll deal with them later. Then be very sweet to your entourage. You should be feeling more positive by day's end.",Cancer
"Feb 20, 2022 - Although your partner may be feeling very sensual at this time, Cancer, you might not feel much like getting passionate. You've had a stressful few days and can barely move, so your response to sexual overtures is apt to be lukewarm at best. Your affection certainly hasn't diminished, but your partner could interpret your behavior that way. Whatever you decide to do, make sure your friend knows exactly how you feel and why you feel that way.",Cancer
"Feb 21, 2022 - The significant other in your life needs your support not a lecture right now, Cancer. Let him or her know you’re available to listen and help in any way, but don’t smother your partner with kindness. He or she will come to you when ready. In the meantime, Cancer, take care of your physical needs. If your body craves exercise, why not increase your jogging miles or add extra time to your gym workout? Absence does make the heart grow fonder, after all.",Cancer
"Feb 22, 2022 - You’ve always had a knack for all things financial, Cancer, but today your ability is especially enhanced. You’ve discovered all the free investing information available over the Internet, and you absorb it like a sponge. Your natural fiscal sense enables you to separate the nonsense from the sound investment advice. Your portfolio and your mood benefit immediately!",Cancer
"Feb 23, 2022 - You’re usually a hard worker, Cancer, whether the work involves a job, personal project, or simply chores around the house. Today, however, you're going through a fit of laziness. Chances are you don't want to do a thing except lie around and read or watch TV. It's OK. We all need time to let our hair down and relax. Don't suffer undue guilt because you don't feel like working.",Cancer
"Feb 24, 2022 - You surprise yourself by signing up for a group lesson rather than a private one. This is unlike you; nevertheless, you find you enjoy the social interaction. Besides, whether you're learning cooking or rock climbing, it's always much more fun to learn with others. That way, you can learn from their mistakes and they from yours. It's bound to be a fun, adventurous day, Cancer. Enjoy it.",Cancer
"Feb 25, 2022 - Let's hope you aren’t afraid of heights, Cancer, because today could have you climbing several rungs on the corporate ladder. It seems your hard work over these last few months has paid off. Don't hesitate to accept the challenge that’s offered to you. If you’re worried about skeletons buried in your office filing cabinets, you’d do well to come clean with the information. Likely your bosses will respect you for your candor and courage.",Cancer
"Feb 26, 2022 - If a family member is in a bad mood but not confessing why, it's up to you to step in and help. He or she is carrying that big black cloud around, casting shadows everywhere they go. Do what you can to snap your relative out of it, although take care not to force the issue too harshly. Counseling might be in order, and this may not be your area of expertise!",Cancer
"Feb 27, 2022 - Information that you retrieve from deep within your psyche might lead to a revelation as to a great way to increase your income, Cancer. This could be something you read and forgot, or it might be something you overheard in a restaurant. Whatever it is, look into it carefully, and then if the information seems to be accurate and useful, go for it. These days, fortunes are being made in surprising ways!",Cancer
"Feb 28, 2022 - You have energy to burn, Cancer, and you intend to use it. Ask friends to join you in the park. Or set up a round-robin tennis match for the afternoon. Enjoy your day outdoors, but take care not to push too hard. If you strain muscles today, it could be weeks before you're fully healed. If you pace yourself and take plenty of water breaks, then you'll enjoy the day with no repercussions.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer

Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Mar 1, 2022 - Profligate spending in the past may come back to haunt you now with regard to money, Cancer. There could be blocks in receiving funds you were expecting or an unexpected but necessary expense could come up. It's going to take all your talent for careful planning to work your way around this situation, but take heart. The situation can turn to a positive one in the blink of an eye, and probably will.",Cancer
"Mar 2, 2022 - You may be feeling especially concerned with others today, Cancer. Your thoughts are with the less fortunate. Perhaps you should consider teaming up with a local church or other community organization to help your immediate community. Your spiritual well-being is also important to you today, and you should do something to honor this part of you. It could be hard for you to keep yourself grounded.",Cancer
"Mar 3, 2022 - Personal or professional projects you've been working on might be moving a bit more slowly than you're comfortable with today, Cancer. You may wonder if this is because you aren't doing something right. This probably isn't the case. It's no doubt just a normal lag in the energy, which should pick up again tomorrow. Keep at it, get done what you have to, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Go with the flow.",Cancer
"Mar 4, 2022 - Opportunities to increase your income by working out of your home could well present themselves today. There might be more than one, and you could be tempted to take them all on. Think about this carefully before you commit, Cancer. You're feeling energetic today, but that could flag on future days. Consider the situation honestly and objectively before making any firm decisions. You don't want to regret it later.",Cancer
"Mar 5, 2022 - Reward yourself for all the great things you've done for you and other people, Cancer. You deserve to be treated like royalty, so make sure that you do. There are many times when you get so critical of the things you do that you end up punishing yourself unnecessarily. Give yourself a treat for being good instead of chastising yourself for being bad. At all times, however, you must remember that you're perfect just the way you are.",Cancer
"Mar 6, 2022 - The key for you is to minimize your daily drama as much as possible, Cancer. You may not realize how much you cripple yourself by the way you exaggerate every aspect of your life. Try not to give so much of your attention to things that really don't matter much. Petty jealousy and gossip about other people's lives are especially irrelevant in your world.",Cancer
"Mar 7, 2022 - You're apt to go in circles if you only see the negative side of every situation, Cancer. Your lack of perspective could keep you from seeing an answer right in front of you. Your mind is your greatest asset and your worst enemy. Don't become a victim of its automatic bias toward the negative. Once you take control and start looking at the positive aspects, the answer will become clear.",Cancer
"Mar 8, 2022 - A phone call from your sweetheart might bring out your passionate, romantic side today, Cancer. You'll probably have a lot to do, and therefore not be able to meet with him or her until late. All signs indicate that the encounter will be worth the wait. You should be especially attuned to your partner right now. You might know instinctively what they need from you now. Buy some new clothes, and enjoy!",Cancer
"Mar 9, 2022 - Take action on well-laid plans today, Cancer. Stay levelheaded, and seek pleasure by taking things steadily one step at a time. Watch out for a forceful, willful, fanciful mindset that will somehow cause conflict with your plans unless you consciously make an effort to keep the daydreaming to a minimum. The lines of reality may be blurred. Make sure you find the lines of distinction before you proceed.",Cancer
"Mar 10, 2022 - The time for planning and calculating is over, Cancer. The time for taking aggressive action has arrived. If you don't have your armor ready, too bad. You'll be thrust onto the battlefield with the rest of the troops even if you're in your underwear. The more you try to delay the inevitable, the more difficult it will be. Bite the bullet and charge full-speed ahead with whatever protective gear you have.",Cancer
"Mar 11, 2022 - Pure wisdom is an important quality for you to aspire to on this day, Cancer. Know that the wisdom you seek should come from a point of calm knowing and strength as opposed to a frantic, loud, and outlandish display for attention. You'll be recognized accordingly. Be aware that the more knowledge you spread to others, the more it will grow for everyone to profit by and share.",Cancer
"Mar 12, 2022 - You may feel anxious today, even more so than usual, Cancer. Your nerves may be quite jittery, and there's a feeling that you may not be on exactly the right track. More than likely, what you need to do is simply calm down and relax. Let your brain slow down and think clearly without the distraction of many people telling you what to do.",Cancer
"Mar 13, 2022 - Inspiration is the keyword for today, Cancer. An optimistic and enthusiastic attitude could lead to powerful imaginings, which may take solid form as plans for future projects.

All signs indicate success on any project begun or completed today.",Cancer
"Mar 14, 2022 - Be careful of gossiping too much with your friends and colleagues, Cancer. It's fun to laugh and exchange stories, but remind yourself of the fact that the truth in a story is diminished and changed each time it's repeated. If you gossip too much, your friends may begin wondering what you say about them when they aren't there. Ultimately, this isn't healthy behavior for your friendships. Think about it.",Cancer
"Mar 15, 2022 - Work could be a real drag today, Cancer. You might be expected to put in more hours than normal. Your heart isn't in it right now. You have interests of your own that you'd rather pursue, plus you could be planning to get together with friends or your partner later. It's best to finish everything quickly, perhaps postponing nonessential tasks, and then go and enjoy yourself.",Cancer
"Mar 16, 2022 - You could be frustrated by others' lack of commitment today, Cancer. You could try to make plans with people but they keep changing their minds about what they want to do. Perhaps they're emotionally insecure and afraid to take the next step. Don't let other people hold you back. Make plans and stick to them. Other people will fall into place accordingly. You don't need to prod them.",Cancer
"Mar 17, 2022 - Your physical energy is high and your ambition even higher, Cancer. You're likely to want to turn your mind to new projects that can advance your socioeconomic status. You could spend a lot of time today gathering information and sending it out, doing whatever it takes to accomplish your goals. A number of short journeys in your neighborhood are definitely on the agenda. Pace yourself so you don't get too tired.",Cancer
"Mar 18, 2022 - You might be a bit confused with the mood of the day, Cancer, which fosters quick action and a sporadic approach to things. More than likely, this approach isn't exactly in line with your usual methodical protocol. Do what you can to merge with this energy in order to add a more spontaneous spark to your daily routine. Take a walk on the wild side today.",Cancer
"Mar 19, 2022 - Today you might feel especially protective toward all those you love: children, family, friends, pets, and the special person in your life, Cancer. Upsetting news might have you wondering about the future, but don't let it get you down. All should be well, so allow yourself to relax and enjoy your loved ones. Distract yourself by going to an exciting movie. That will help release tension and put you in a better frame of mind.",Cancer
"Mar 20, 2022 - A rush of humanitarian spirit and a desire to do some real good might find you looking into various charities in order to find those you might want to help. However, money could be flowing out for other purposes a bit too quickly for your tastes, Cancer. It perhaps would be best to find one group that suits you and give only to that one. Save other worthy causes for another time.",Cancer
"Mar 21, 2022 - A lot of warm and loving communications could come your way today, Cancer. It could be in the form of letters, phone calls, emails, or texts Friends from far away whom you haven't heard from in a long time could keep you busy catching up on the phone. Relations with family members or a partner are likely to be supportive and intimate today. With this, your appreciation of those in your life may be highlighted.",Cancer
"Mar 22, 2022 - Today you might want to put your innate business sense into making a success of a pet project of your own. This is a good idea, Cancer, because all signs indicate that whatever you begin today, whether it's for your employer or yourself, could well lead to success. You could, however, find yourself spending a little more money than you would normally care to. Don't hold yourself back, but be careful!",Cancer
"Mar 23, 2022 - Occult sciences, such as alchemy, phrenology, and astrology, could be singing their siren song to you, Cancer. You like to think of yourself as down to Earth and realistic, but today you could find so-called unrealistic fields of knowledge irresistible. You'll also have a special gift for them right now. Read up on the subject and give it a try. You might be surprised at what you discover.",Cancer
"Mar 24, 2022 - A long-anticipated visit from a close friend or love partner may have to be postponed, Cancer. This could be rather disheartening. You may fear that the postponement implies that the visit will never happen, but this isn't the case. Your friend has probably run into a few snags that need to be straightened out. Be patient and hang in there. All should work out as you want, albeit a bit later!",Cancer
"Mar 25, 2022 - Your intuition has been steadily increasing over the past few months, Cancer, and today it could operate at a particularly high level. More than one premonition may come to you, and you'll probably find yourself picking up more frequently on the thoughts and feelings of others. If you're into the arts, inspiration may come that you should definitely make use of. Don't worry about what's practical. Think of inspiration as an assignment from the Universe!",Cancer
"Mar 26, 2022 - You must weigh your physical limitations with your desire to get everything done, Cancer. You run the risk of wearing yourself out and getting sick just as you finish your tasks. Enlist the help of others, if you can, for all those chores and errands that absolutely need to be done. You should definitely leave anything that can wait. Your health needs to come first!",Cancer
"Mar 27, 2022 - Money earned through involvement in the arts, perhaps those combining creativity with computer technology, could come your way, Cancer. Financially, you should be doing fairly well, so you might channel what you receive right back into this business. This is an excellent time to do this, as all signs indicate that this sort of activity could be very profitable over the next few years. Go for the gold, and enjoy yourself.",Cancer
"Mar 28, 2022 - Suddenly you seem more glamorous than usual, Cancer. You may exert a mysterious appeal that in the 1920s was called ""it."" Current and potential love partners may take a second look and be intrigued. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from strangers! This could make a big difference in your love life. Lovers you encounter today should continue to see something in you for a long time. Make the most of ""it""!",Cancer
"Mar 29, 2022 - A project that you're working on, perhaps job related, perhaps personal, is likely to require more creative skill than you usually need, Cancer. Writing, drawing, or computer graphics could be involved. You might have some doubts about your abilities, but you're more likely to be surprised by the results. You're apt to enjoy working this way, and you may hope to continue. Keep up the good work, and good luck!",Cancer
"Mar 30, 2022 - Are you expecting a close friend or love partner to visit you at home, Cancer? Don't panic if your friend doesn't show up at the allotted time. It doesn't mean that no one is coming! There probably has been a traffic jam, last-minute phone call, long line at the supermarket, or some other mundane delay. Be patient and your friend will show up eventually. Hang in there!",Cancer
"Mar 31, 2022 - Do you have the uncomfortable feeling that you've forgotten something but you have no idea what it is, Cancer? Are you haunted by the memory of a seemingly insignificant past event, but can't figure out why? It isn't a good idea to obsess over either. You'll remember whatever it is eventually. You'll soon realize the significance of the memory. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something. You can't rush it, so relax!",Cancer
"Apr 1, 2022 - As you work slowly and steadily toward your goals, realize that there are apt to be unexpected obstacles along the way, Cancer. You can't possibly plan for everything, so don't get discouraged today when some crazy variable pops out of nowhere. Your mental process may be thrown for a loop, and you might find that you go into a frenzy. There's a valuable lesson to be learned here - patience.",Cancer
"Apr 2, 2022 - Once you've made up your mind, Cancer, it's doubtful that anyone can change it. You're set in your ways and your plans are set in stone. Having this solid base to stand on will let others support you effectively. You're trustworthy and predictable. Others can depend on you and know where they stand in relation to you. Don't let self-doubt slip in. This is your time to stand tall and proud.",Cancer
"Apr 3, 2022 - You might be frustrated with romance because it seems to be causing more tension than relaxation, Cancer. No one said love was easy, but it doesn't have to be miserable. The key is to not get too stressed out about the little things. Know and expect that some things aren't going to match your expectations. You simply have no control over some aspects of a relationship - the other person, for example.",Cancer
"Apr 4, 2022 - Generally, you come up with the perfect, witty answer one day too late. Impulse and intuition take a back seat to your excellent self-control. The day ahead presents one opportunity to let go of the inhibition that sometimes stymies you. Yield to your instincts a little and see what happens. A little more socializing wouldn't hurt, either. You're certainly entitled to some fun now and then!",Cancer
"Apr 5, 2022 - When you woke up this morning, you may have felt an oppressive mood hanging in the air. Unfortunately, that haze of misunderstanding and conflict is likely to last all day. However, it makes this an ideal time to speak up about anything that's bothering you! Don't be shy about going on the warpath today. If you don't, Cancer, you're likely to be the target of a surprise attack.",Cancer
"Apr 6, 2022 - A rather upsetting dream could disturb your sleep tonight, Cancer. When you wake up and focus on the real world, it could seem so bizarre as to not be worthy of serious consideration. Nonetheless, write it down. After some time has passed, go over the symbols and see what they suggest to you. The dream is trying to tell you something about a specific situation in your life, albeit in a weird way!",Cancer
"Apr 7, 2022 - A public figure, perhaps an author, might capture your interest in some way today, Cancer. This person could have a lot to say that appeals to you on a number of different levels. You'll want to acquaint yourself with as much of this person's work as possible. You could experience some valuable personal insights. Don't worry if your practical mind chides you for this obsession. Sometimes it's a good thing!",Cancer
"Apr 8, 2022 - An opportunity to travel to a place you've always wanted to visit, perhaps for business reasons, could come your way today, Cancer. This could be very exciting, but you might have some difficulty making the arrangements. Flights could be full, hotels too costly, and responsibilities at home might need attention. But you can find a way to deal with any obstacle. Think creatively and get busy!",Cancer
"Apr 9, 2022 - Plans to go away on vacation or perhaps a business trip could be put on hold today, Cancer. Events you might have been scheduled to attend could be temporarily postponed. This could leave you feeling somewhat at a loss because you'd planned to be away and now you don't know what to do with yourself in the meantime. Be your usual ingenious self and you'll find something! Go to it!",Cancer
"Apr 10, 2022 - Communication takes a prominent place in your life today, Cancer. Your practical, direct, and down-to-Earth manner can be very impressive. You're known for succeeding where others have failed. This isn't lost on those above you on the hierarchical ladder. And they know that you aren't easily fooled. Expect steady personal and professional progress and a great boost to your self-confidence!",Cancer
"Apr 11, 2022 - Your values could undergo a complete turnaround today, Cancer. Recent developments in the world, your community, among your circle of friends, and within you could make you realize, like it or not, you and everyone around you is going through a transformation. This might be a little disconcerting, but it's a positive development. Take things one day at a time and see where they go. You'll probably like it!",Cancer
"Apr 12, 2022 - You're too hard on yourself, Cancer. If things haven't gone exactly as planned over the last few days, there's no sense in berating yourself over it. As long as you did the best that you could, what's the problem? It's likely you've experienced a delay and not a cancellation. All signs indicate that your goals will come to fruition even though it might take longer than you'd anticipated.",Cancer
"Apr 13, 2022 - You're looking good and your social skills are at their peak, Cancer. Therefore, social events and group activities that you might attend today could well be the most satisfying and beneficial you've known in a long time. People you meet should be impressed with you, and you could make a lot of new friends. If you aren't romantically involved now, a new love could come your way.",Cancer
"Apr 14, 2022 - You're likely to receive news today that brightens your future outlook, Cancer. It could be that your boss calls you at home and hints at a pending promotion, or your partner could receive a raise or unusually large bonus. Whatever the news, know that your financial picture will begin to look dramatically better than it has been. Start making plans for how you'll improve your lifestyle. A vacation may just be in order.",Cancer
"Apr 15, 2022 - You might be feeling a little tense because you and your partner are grappling with some thorny financial issues right now, Cancer. You could be frustrated because you need to postpone some purchases or investments until the cash starts flowing more freely again. The good news is that this is a fine time to work out such a conflict to a satisfactory resolution. Both of you will need to be open-minded and look at all sides as you make your decisions.",Cancer
"Apr 16, 2022 - You work hard to reach your goal of financial independence, Cancer. All signs indicate that you're well on your way. Today you could receive some news that makes you realize you aren't there yet. Perhaps a relative calls to say you're no longer his/her sole beneficiary. Maybe your investment statement shows a poor return. This isn't what you expected, but you're still on the right track. It just might take a bit longer to reach your destination.",Cancer
"Apr 17, 2022 - Keep your eyes and ears open to all new possibilities, Cancer. Even if it isn't your habit to read the ""Help Wanted"" section of the newspaper, do so today. You might be surprised at what you find there. Your skills apply to all sorts of jobs. You don't need to limit your search to one profession. You have a good mind that's working in overdrive now. Use it to figure out the next steps for your advancement.",Cancer
"Apr 18, 2022 - Today should be a ""no holds barred"" day as you strategize your next career move, Cancer. If you were in the army, you'd be a five-star general by now - your tactical sense is that good. Unfortunately, your office isn't handing out stars. You'll have to be satisfied with a raise and promotion - the least they can offer after all your hard work. If no such offer is forthcoming, go and ask for it!",Cancer
"Apr 19, 2022 - If you're feeling needy today, you might consider seeking counsel from others, Cancer. Close partners might make light of the situation, so if you're looking for deep metaphysical advice, you might want to look elsewhere. Most of all, pamper yourself with some relaxing downtime. This day is well suited for playing board games, watching a movie, or reading the latest edition of your favorite magazine.",Cancer
"Apr 20, 2022 - A future course of action that you may or may not take could depend on information you might receive today, Cancer. However, don't be surprised if the information is vague and needs to be clarified. On top of it all, you might not be able to reach the person who can clear it up for you! Hang in there. You'll want to make up your mind as soon as possible.",Cancer
"Apr 21, 2022 - If you've been uncertain about the possibility of a raise in your salary, Cancer, today you could finally be told for certain that it's coming. This is definitely cause for celebration. You might want to call a friend or romantic partner and propose a night on the town. Your good luck shows signs of continuing if you keep on working as hard as you have been. Now it's time to enjoy it!",Cancer
"Apr 22, 2022 - A love partner could contact you out of the blue, Cancer, perhaps proposing that the two of you get together tonight - alone. You're in just the mood for this, since you're feeling especially sexy and not particularly afraid to show it. An evening at home or in a dark corner of your favorite restaurant might be just the ticket. Don't be surprised if your friend orders champagne and shows up with flowers! Have fun!",Cancer
"Apr 23, 2022 - There is a lot of tension in the air today, Cancer. It isn't just affecting your home environment - everyone you meet seems out of sorts. You'll be happiest if you spend much of today in solitude. Books don't honk their horn at you and DVDs don't curse your driving ability. Who needs the aggravation that a day like today can bring? Enjoy a day away from other people's bad moods.",Cancer
"Apr 24, 2022 - You always suspected that your job was making you crazy, but it never occurred to you that it could make you sick, too. Is it really worth it, Cancer? You may be asking yourself this question today. Fortunately, your talents apply to several professions. Why not take a closer look at other fields? One way or another, it's clear that change is coming. You might as well be the one who directs it.",Cancer
"Apr 25, 2022 - Today is another passionate day in a series of passionate days! Usually, Cancer, you're a fairly reserved person where feelings are concerned. You'll be much more demonstrative with your emotions over the next few days. You can be like a fire trapped inside a wall of ice, and today that ice is beginning to melt! Let it – and enjoy it!",Cancer
"Apr 26, 2022 - Don't hesitate to try something new today, Cancer. If you've thought about joining a book club or taking a class, do it today! You're likely to meet some interesting people and enter a new social world. You might be tentative at first, but you'll find the group warm, friendly, and eager for your input. You'll talk like old friends by the end of the second meeting. This is just the infusion of fun you need!",Cancer
"Apr 27, 2022 - Your financial goals could seem vague and uncertain at this time, Cancer. Perhaps you face a crossroads in your life as far as income goes, and you might not be sure which way to go. Or else you could be planning to make some purchases and have a hard time deciding which are most important. This probably isn't the day to try to make any kind of decision. Wait a day or two.",Cancer
"Apr 28, 2022 - Have you been thinking about getting fit by investing in some exercise equipment? If so, Cancer, this might be the day to actually go out and get it. Don't be surprised if friends, relatives, and neighbors all want to come over and try it out. Health and fitness are very much on your mind right now, so you might also want to pick up some books on whatever discipline interests you the most.",Cancer
"Apr 29, 2022 - A friend might be in such a dour mood that you wonder if this is the same person you know and love, Cancer. During the day you might be tempted to try to analyze what's going on, but this is apt to raise more questions than answers. Probably this is a case of too many problems hitting your friend at once. Don't pry, but make sure your friend knows you're there if needed.",Cancer
"Apr 30, 2022 - You may have been wishing for some recognition and appreciation lately. Perhaps you had your eye on a promotion at work. The day ahead will show you which path will be the most productive. In order to succeed, Cancer, you have to plan everything carefully and focus on one goal. You should be sure you have support for that goal. There's a long, hard climb ahead, but you're bound to make it!",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"May 1, 2022 - The day will be fairly quiet for you, Cancer. You're likely to yoke yourself to a task and continue working on it until evening. If someone tries to persuade you to take a break, it won't be all that difficult to resist. This is one day when you should follow your instincts, keep your head down, and focus on the task at hand.",Cancer
"May 2, 2022 - The best way to create harmony among others is to first establish harmony in yourself, Cancer. Don't expect others to take care of you and attend to all your desires. At the same time, it isn't your responsibility to dote on others. The boundaries may get ambiguous at times, but do your best to maintain a healthy separation. People may pull on your heartstrings to manipulate you into doing what they want. Don't fall for it.",Cancer
"May 3, 2022 - Today is the kind of day when all you want to do is think about a vacation. You're usually such a responsible, conscientious worker that you can afford to escape for just a few minutes. You could visit the world inside of you. You may even find something that's been on your mind for quite some time that requires some action by you now.",Cancer
"May 4, 2022 - You might decide to spend a large part of the day working on a project that requires a lot of mental energy. Plans to spend some time with either a close friend or lover might not turn out to be quite what you'd hoped, Cancer. Your friend could be in a rather gloomy mood. A relaxing evening, perhaps a concert or funny movie, can release tension and boost bad moods. Enjoy!",Cancer
"May 5, 2022 - Some short trips in your neighborhood and contact with neighbors or visitors to your community could bring some interesting information your way, Cancer. It gets you thinking about ways to improve your socioeconomic status and probably your professional standing. Spiritual and philosophical discussions could also take place. In addition, your insights can prove as valuable as any outside information. Trust your intuition and follow your heart.",Cancer
"May 6, 2022 - Finding the comfort point may be difficult for you, Cancer. You might feel as if you aren't connecting with your ideals or goals. Even though you try to put things into motion, they don't really pan out the way you'd like. There's a difficult energy making you feel like you need to join one camp or the other to feel accepted. The problem is that neither side looks appealing. Feel free to start your own camp.",Cancer
"May 7, 2022 - Love and romance should be going well for you now, Cancer. However, today you could find that things get a bit uneasy when either you or your partner suspects something isn't true or is suspicious about the situation at hand. Someone may get caught in a difficult predicament when the veil of deception is suddenly lifted and the truth revealed. There could be some difficult explaining to do.",Cancer
"May 8, 2022 - You may have been feeling somewhat disillusioned. Perhaps you lost sight of your goals or misplaced your faith in yourself. You'll feel some relief beginning today. This is an opportunity to end what has been a somewhat apathetic and moody phase and begin a new one that's based on work and meditation. As you can imagine, this new phase will be much more fulfilling!",Cancer
"May 9, 2022 - You're a great creator of systems, Cancer. You can tinker with every sort of construction, from theories and computer programs to scientific experiments and strategic evaluations. Today the planets are guiding you. You're a perfect computer, capable of synthesizing random events into pure reason. You're sure to attract attention if you share your thoughts with others.",Cancer
"May 10, 2022 - Your ideas about life are going through some radical changes. None of the givens that you've always taken for granted apply any more, Cancer. Rather than lament the changes, grow from them. So don't drag your feet! Stand up and move ahead. This is no time for a vacation. You have some rebuilding to do.",Cancer
"May 11, 2022 - You'll go one of two ways today, Cancer. Either you'll turn inward and meditate in a corner or you'll find a good friend and confide your dissatisfaction. Don't hesitate to let your guard down and express yourself even more honestly than is typical for you. Have no worries that your problems will bore your friend. True friends are happy to help. You'd do the same, wouldn't you?",Cancer
"May 12, 2022 - Expect a lot of intellectual stimulation to come your way today, Cancer. Important news could come on the phone, necessitating action on your part in order to bring about a desired end. You might need to spend time in the car, contacting others in the neighborhood. The excitement of the moment could have you feeling especially optimistic, but take care to pace yourself. Exhaustion could prove counterproductive now.",Cancer
"May 13, 2022 - Discard those items from the past for which you really no longer have use. As much as you like to surround yourself with objects of sentimental value, the time comes when it's necessary to look to the future rather than dwell on the past. The time spent cleaning your home and throwing out extraneous things will release you from the past and allow you to embrace the future.",Cancer
"May 14, 2022 - An important aspect has passed, and you are in the process of reaping the benefit from it, Cancer. It was only a matter of becoming aware of and settling certain matters related to your need for social recognition. Don't be so hungry for approval, Cancer. Most people contain a stern inner authority figure and can survive comfortably and self-sufficiently. In fact, it's your greatest strength.",Cancer
"May 15, 2022 - You may have felt an oppressive mood hanging in the air when you woke up this morning, Cancer. Unfortunately, that haze of misunderstanding and conflict is likely to last all day. However, it makes this an ideal time to speak up about anything that's bothering you! Don't be shy about going on the warpath today. If you don't, you're likely to be the target of a surprise attack.",Cancer
"May 16, 2022 - Your current plan of attack may run into some snags today, Cancer. This might be caused by an emotional need that you may not have recognized earlier. The problem is that your head may say one thing while your gut tells you something else. You might need to put everything on hold while you sort out this inner turmoil. There's a great deal of compassion in the air.",Cancer
"May 17, 2022 - Today time will stop and might even seem to go backward, Cancer. Use this pause to reflect on your motivations. The clues from the Zodiac seem to suggest that you're currently settling questions that concern the fate of another person. Perhaps you should be spending an equal amount of time considering your own fate as well.",Cancer

If you haven't been spending enough quality time with your partner, you'd better make up for it now. Your mate will be overjoyed.",Cancer
"May 19, 2022 - You might find it easier to connect with others at this time, Cancer. It would behoove you to reconnect with friends or family members you may have lost touch with.

Don't hesitate to get out there and mix and mingle!",Cancer
"May 20, 2022 - Connect with the stabilizing force of the day, Cancer. It's important for you to keep at least one foot on the ground, as powerful and intense emotions are likely to try to take over the scene. This is a good time to do things with passion. Don't hold back. Whatever you do today, you need to give it all or nothing. There is no room for any half-hearted attempts.",Cancer
"May 21, 2022 - Is there some material need weighing on your spirit right now, Cancer? If you can't see how to solve the problem alone, why not discuss it with your friends? They may have some ideas. Today, the word ""impossible"" has been banished from the English language. Take advantage of the opportunity to look for solutions in unlikely places.",Cancer
"May 22, 2022 - Don't put up with anyone's shenanigans, Cancer. Your time is too precious and your energy too powerful to waste on those who see you as a fair-weather friend or emotional crutch. Concentrate on your own problems. If someone has a sob story, tell him or her exactly what you think. No need to pad the honest truth with a bunch of fluff just to make the other person feel good.",Cancer
"May 23, 2022 - You, of all people, will appreciate the need for structure and stability on a day like this, Cancer. This practical energy could be taking some of the fun out of the equation. You may not recognize it at first, but if you aren't careful, the fun in your life could be chipped away little by little. Make sure you hold tight to the things that give your life passion and purpose.",Cancer
"May 24, 2022 - If you're in love, Cancer, you'll love today. You could plan for almost anything from a little trip together to a lifetime full of children and grandchildren.

The future will be a bright contrast after the comparative gloom of the past few weeks.",Cancer
"May 25, 2022 - Your mind should be quite clear today, and communication will go extremely well for you, Cancer. You'll find that you'll need very few words to get your point across.

Be patient and you'll find that even your wildest fantasies will start to come to fruition.",Cancer
"May 27, 2022 - Things may not be as obvious as they first seem today, Cancer. Don't get started on a project until you understand the full scope of what you're getting into.

Don't be surprised if your motivation suddenly dissipates and you're left with no incentive to get your work done.",Cancer
"May 28, 2022 - The solar system is shifting gears today, Cancer, and it's liable to trigger a great transformation that will last seven months. The change will center on the means you use to fulfill yourself in terms of both your career and love life.

"May 29, 2022 - You may be at a point where you just want to stop and rest, Cancer. This is the time to do so. You deserve a break, so take this day and enjoy yourself.

The more of yourself that you share with others, the more respect you'll gain from them.",Cancer
"May 30, 2022 - Try to feel at ease today, Cancer. Remember that inner peace is a big part of your health, and maintaining that baseline is critical during a pandemic.

Others are likely to feel sensitive and weepy as well, so have them join you in this exercise.",Cancer
"May 31, 2022 - Examine your emotions, Cancer, and trust your instincts. Unexpected forces may disrupt your preferred flow of things. Know that you'll have no problem keeping the situation under control as long as you stay solid and focused. Your actions today will have long-lasting effects, so be conscious of how you use your energy. Incorporate the old as well as the new in your game plan.",Cancer
"Jun 1, 2022 - Love and romance are likely to be tops on your agenda today, Cancer. You're feeling especially warm and loving now.

"Jun 2, 2022 - Experiences you never expected could come your way today, Cancer. A talent that you didn't know you had could come to light.

You might also try fundraising for a charity or a social or political cause. Don't hesitate. Go to it.",Cancer
"Jun 3, 2022 - You might be expecting some visitors to your home, Cancer, and looking forward to it. However, your plans could be frustrated in some way through miscommunication, undelivered messages, delays due to traffic, or other obstacles. Don't let this dim your enthusiasm. Whatever you're trying to do will eventually come to fruition in spite of temporary frustrations. Don't give up. Enjoy your evening.",Cancer
"Jun 4, 2022 - The economy could well take another dip, Cancer, and you might hear from people expressing concerns about financial matters.

Take no drastic action just yet. Wait and see what happens. You'll probably breathe a sigh of relief.",Cancer
"Jun 5, 2022 - Romance is center stage today as unexpected circumstances put you in touch with interesting people of both sexes, Cancer.

Stimulating discussions about various subjects set your imagination going and increase your desire to learn more. Enjoy your day.",Cancer
"Jun 6, 2022 - Children cross your path today for a reason. You might get caught up in their games and momentarily experience being a child again yourself. This could increase your appeal for love partners, Cancer, so don't be surprised if you're the recipient of admiring advances from others. At some point, you might be the center of attention, which is flattering. Enjoy!",Cancer
"Jun 7, 2022 - Today dreams, visions, and intuitive insights enrich your innovative side and interactions with others. Don't hesitate to put your ideas into motion, Cancer, even if they seem a bit too ambitious. You're well attuned to the collective unconscious and likely to be picking up on future trends, so be on the alert. You're feeling especially sexy in the evening, so plan an intimate get-together with your lover if possible.",Cancer
"Jun 8, 2022 - You've been working hard lately and giving a lot of your energy to others, Cancer. Today you're feeling tired. There will be tension in the air throughout the day. You may feel that certain people that you considered friends now disappoint you. Don't get tangled up in their superficiality. It's probably wise to put some distance between you and these people.",Cancer
"Jun 9, 2022 - You're naturally involved in things and bursting with energy. You're also trying to work on how you relate to other people. However, you tend to want to get too involved in their lives at home and work. You even tend to do their work for them sometimes. Try to avoid overworking yourself. Think about how you fit into the group around you.",Cancer
"Jun 10, 2022 - We all have to make compromises in order to live in contemporary society. You may have strong beliefs, but it's difficult to combine your ideals and a social life. Today you may wonder if you're prepared to be edged out of society and fight for your convictions. Shouldn't you try to find a compromise between life and your ideals?",Cancer
"Jun 11, 2022 - Relationships of all kinds are likely to be strengthened by an increased level of understanding today, Cancer. Your thinking is greatly enhanced by your emotional intuitiveness, so you'll be more able than usual to identify with the needs and desires of those around you. As a result, acquaintances could become friends, and friendships could progress into bonds that last for life. Romance also benefits from intensified empathy. Enjoy.",Cancer
"Jun 12, 2022 - If you need to execute legal papers of any kind, Cancer, you couldn't find a better day to do it. Relationships, particularly romantic ones, should be especially warm, supportive, and rewarding. New and interesting people could cross your path. You might feel an instant bond with at least one of them. If you aren't currently romantically involved, you could well experience something exciting today. Communicating with new people is gratifying and stimulating.",Cancer
"Jun 13, 2022 - You have a natural ability to accomplish a great deal rather easily, Cancer. But today you may feel snowed under with projects. Things around you might be moving quickly, and perhaps you're having difficulty dealing with it all. For once, try to take it easy. You don't need to struggle all the time in order to be accepted by the world. Lighten up!",Cancer
"Jun 14, 2022 - Even though the times are favorable for relaxation, you won't be able to fully enjoy this period, Cancer. You'll instead try to adjust your agenda so you can lead a more balanced life. The planetary aspects in play will incite you to change your attitude toward work. You should try to lighten your responsibilities to avoid stress as much as possible.",Cancer
"Jun 15, 2022 - Discussions involving a group you're affiliated with could lead to some deep subjects, such as philosophy, metaphysics, science - or all three. Your mind should be quick and sharp today, Cancer, on both a logical and an intuitive level. You'll probably soak up just about everything you hear. You could give it a lot of thought, and yes, you should be able to make sense of it all.",Cancer
"Jun 16, 2022 - A partnership of some kind, perhaps business, perhaps romantic, is likely to be on your mind today. You might want to seriously consider whether or not it has a future, and if it does, what to do next. You could spend time socializing, if possible, but you could be too preoccupied to participate much. A lot of serious decisions need to be made, Cancer. The outcome is likely to be positive. Try to relax and have some fun.",Cancer
"Jun 17, 2022 - You're organized and rigorous, Cancer. You plan everything. But with today's energy, you'll be inclined to let the day go by without keeping to a tight schedule. After all, not every day has to be a workday. You can worry easily, but don't let this get you down. Follow the people around you. They'll teach you to see the world differently. You'll even think about new ways to organize your life.",Cancer
"Jun 18, 2022 - How about changing roles today, Cancer? It's true that you aren't one for idle chat. You prefer taking action rather than talking about grandiose ideas that never go anywhere. Yet today you may actually feel like discussing things in depth. The stars' alignments are bringing out this other side of you, so take advantage of the energy. Other people will be grateful since they've been waiting a long time for this day.",Cancer
"Jun 19, 2022 - You tend to think that you're the only person on this planet born under a lucky star, Cancer. Try to trust the ones you love, because they might not appreciate having to deal with your anxiety. Don't forget that they also know how to fend for themselves. They, too, have had to adapt to this world we live in. They can stand up for themselves.",Cancer
"Jun 20, 2022 - Have you been spending a lot of time pushing your body physically, Cancer? If so, you may be feeling the effects today. Muscle aches and exhaustion could be taking their toll on you. Forget about projects and chores and take care of yourself for a while. Try to get some rest. You won't be any good to anyone if you make yourself a martyr. Tomorrow you should be your old self again.",Cancer
"Jun 21, 2022 - You might be charged with energy but feel you have nowhere to aim it, Cancer. The force is there, but the goal may not be. Talking with others may only confuse you.

There's nothing wrong with stillness.",Cancer
"Jun 22, 2022 - This is a terrific day for you, Cancer. You'll notice a sense of well-being that makes you feel secure that all your hard work is finally starting to pay off. It's as if you've reached a comfortable ledge in your trek up the mountain. This is a good resting spot that will let you catch your breath for a moment. Take this opportunity to relax and regroup.",Cancer
"Jun 23, 2022 - Certain situations may be difficult to deal with today as they take an emotional spin, Cancer. You're getting anxious. Things are getting started without the careful planning and consideration you feel is necessary. Try not to worry so much. Your own doubt is likely to hinder any project. Have faith that things will work out. Be bold. Take an active role in helping to get the ball rolling instead of holding it back.",Cancer
"Jun 24, 2022 - Your high from your recent successes could have you wanting to go crazy purchasing luxury items you didn't feel were practical before, Cancer. This is fine as long as you're discriminating and don't give in to impulse buying. This also isn't a good time to overindulge in food and drink. You should definitely enjoy your successes while still making use of your common sense.",Cancer
"Jun 25, 2022 - Romance blossoms for you tonight, Cancer, perhaps after a long period of standing still. A new sense of stability and security may settle on love relationships and close friendships.

"Jun 26, 2022 - You could get some mysterious phone calls today, Cancer, like wrong numbers or hang-ups. Other people might seem less communicative than usual, Cancer, and you're likely to be preoccupied with your own thoughts. You might feel a bit more nervous than usual, but that should go away if you take a brisk walk or get some other exercise. If you've been thinking about doing some writing, this is the day to start.",Cancer
"Jun 27, 2022 - Enjoy yourself today, Cancer. You have a great deal to be grateful for, so give thanks. Take pride in all that you've accomplished so far and share your joy with others.

Take time to be with loved ones tonight.",Cancer
"Jun 28, 2022 - A close friend or member of your household could be having money problems, Cancer, and want to draw on your good business sense in order to understand the situation and find ways to put it right.

"Jun 29, 2022 - The world is wide open to you today, Cancer. Take advantage of all the great things on offer. You may not realize it, but you have a loyal fan club building in the wings.

Your grounded mind and solid perspective are incredible assets in any situation.",Cancer
"Jun 30, 2022 - If the doorknob doesn't want to turn today, Cancer, don't force it. You'll only succeed in breaking the key. Perhaps you just need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't have to be a struggle. Our job is to be happy. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a rest period.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Jul 1, 2022 - Try to keep yourself in line with your emotions today, Cancer. It's possible that a powerful yet subtle force is slowly trying to pull you off track.

Go for a walk with a friend to help clear your head so you can think more rationally about the decisions you need to make.",Cancer
"Jul 2, 2022 - Take a break from your steady climb today and have a look at the world around you, Cancer. Enjoy a night out with friends, if possible, and take an active role in the conversation. You'll find that the more socializing you do (even if its remotely), the more you'll be able to release some of the tension that you might not even realize you have. Get the energy moving again. Take an active role in keeping up with the beat.",Cancer
"Jul 3, 2022 - Enlist the help of others today, Cancer. You'll find that information exchange is the key to putting the last few puzzle pieces into place. Doing things on your own is important and necessary. At some point you need to realize that the next major step requires a certain amount of input from others. Gather data and apply it to your situation. Don't become a leach or burden to others.",Cancer
"Jul 4, 2022 - Don't run away from tension today, Cancer. Any sort of emotional stress you feel will be compounded tremendously if it isn't dealt with right away. Be in the moment while the moment is here. The more you face in the present, the less you'll regret in the future. Clear up any sticky situation that arises and move forward. People may not understand your needs and concerns until you verbalize them clearly.",Cancer
"Jul 5, 2022 - Your dreams won't come true unless you believe in and act on them, Cancer. No one else is going to do it for you. Unless you have a fairy godmother, you need to take matters into your own hands. Realize, however, that you can get there many different ways. The first step is to believe in yourself. Anything is possible. Today is a great day to let your imagination call the shots.",Cancer
"Jul 6, 2022 - Don't automatically assume that you can work out all your problems by yourself, Cancer. Just the act of talking things over with others can help shed light on a situation that was baffling you earlier. Enlist the help of others in areas where you need help. Don't be ashamed to ask for assistance. We all have problems and issues to deal with. You aren't alone.",Cancer
"Jul 7, 2022 - If you're talking about another person today, Cancer, make sure you aren't saying anything that would be upsetting if they were standing right there. Gossip may be running rampant, but that's no excuse for you to contribute to it. Be aware that what you say has a strong impact on the people around you and is likely to reach many more ears than you may think.",Cancer
"Jul 8, 2022 - You may feel a sense of restriction to the day, but in truth, this is for your own good, Cancer. You'll find that your acute sense of discipline comes in handy today as you tackle work with incredible enthusiasm. Your goals aren't far from your grasp. Stay focused, and don't let the ticking clock pressure you. Hastiness will lead to careless mistakes. If you're going to do a job, do it right.",Cancer
"Jul 9, 2022 - Take time out from your work today and relax a little, Cancer. Let your romantic nature have some fun and don't feel guilty about not being as serious as you think you should be. The winner of the day is the one who can smile the most, so enter this contest with the intent of coming out on top. The rewards will last a long time. Those you encounter won't be able to help smiling back.",Cancer
"Jul 10, 2022 - It's likely that the previous few days have been especially hectic, Cancer. Today you're apt to entertain a few daydreams about getting away from it all. Perhaps there's another field that you've wanted to pursue. You might actually think seriously about it now. Don't make any plans until you're back in the material world. You might feel too fanciful to be your usual practical self.",Cancer
"Jul 11, 2022 - You're likely to face conflicting reports today, Cancer. Information may be tainted with emotion, so be careful about going with the choice that shouts the loudest. You may be getting secretly pigeonholed into a place where you don't want to be. Heed the internal warnings you receive. This is a good day to do things passionately. Take care of any detective work that needs doing.",Cancer
"Jul 12, 2022 - You may be a bit daunted by the frenzy of energy present in the air today, Cancer. Try not to get thrown off balance by others who may be more abrasive than usual. Use this as a time of release for yourself. By letting others open up the cold, hard truth to you, you have the opportunity to let out your own truth as well. Unexpected events are likely to come on the scene.",Cancer
"Jul 13, 2022 - Your mind is especially sharp, Cancer. You're logical and objective by nature. However, today you're likely to find that your thinking is more influenced by feeling than usual. This is a positive development. It demonstrates that your intuition is operating at a high level, so don't fight it. This is definitely the day to follow your heart rather than your head.",Cancer
"Jul 14, 2022 - With the current aspects at play, Cancer, you could find that the hard work you've done in the past finally brings financial rewards. This will make you very happy, but don't get carried away and go on a spending spree! Treat yourself a little. Celebrate with a friend, if possible. Take care to exercise a little good sense. You don't want to buy too much and have to take a lot of it back to the store.",Cancer
"Jul 15, 2022 - A male friend could put you in touch with people from foreign countries or people who have traveled a lot. They might have valuable information that you could use later. This information could also help you finish old projects that have been waiting to be done. Your eye for detail is especially acute, Cancer. Make notes of interesting facts even if they don't apply right now. You'll make good use of them later.",Cancer
"Jul 16, 2022 - There are days when you feel wonderful without being able to attribute the feeling to any real event. Of course, your rational mind will search for a reason for the happiness. If you count the number of times when you do things against your will or better judgment, it becomes obvious that logic and reason don't always apply to this world. Don't even try to understand, Cancer, just enjoy!",Cancer
"Jul 17, 2022 - Hard work on a particular enterprise for too long a time could finally lead to an increase in income, Cancer. Creativity or innovation could be involved.

Take your partner out for a celebration. You deserve it.",Cancer
"Jul 18, 2022 - Ingenious techniques for growing your money could come your way today, Cancer. While you aren't one to jump into anything, you're certainly likely to give these ideas serious thought. Take care to only go for those that are totally up front, with no hidden sides. Your passion for delving into new professional fields is only surpassed by your romantic passions. Plan a seductive evening with a partner. Make it a night to remember!",Cancer
"Jul 19, 2022 - It's important for you not to overanalyze every little detail of your situation now, Cancer, especially when it comes to love and romance issues. You could be jumping to ridiculous conclusions based purely on circumstantial evidence. Don't lose sleep over things that you don't even know to be true. Release your stranglehold on certain issues and concentrate on simply rebuilding your own self-confidence.",Cancer
"Jul 20, 2022 - This day bodes well for accomplishments in business and finance. Long-term investments of either time or funds may finally pay off. New opportunities could come your way. This is a better time to complete old projects than start new ones, Cancer, but if you must, new projects started now should be successful. Celebrate by treating yourself to new clothes. Wear them for a longtime friend or lover this evening.",Cancer
"Jul 21, 2022 - You're apt to feel more talkative than usual, Cancer. There are many times when you may shrink from a situation in disgust or perhaps boredom. You're usually anxious to move from one scene and get on with the next. Feel free to call the shots and speak your mind. Others are more likely to listen to what you have to say, so be honest when someone comes to you with a question or situation that he or she needs help with.",Cancer
"Jul 22, 2022 - It's OK to change your opinion, Cancer. You may pride yourself on being the solid one who always has an answer or knows exactly where to go.

Keep your mind open to changes that occur around you and maybe you'll have a change of heart.",Cancer
"Jul 23, 2022 - Things should be flowing quite well for you today, Cancer. Take this opportunity and use the energy to its full potential. Center yourself and look at the weeks ahead.

You have a great deal going for you, so don't waste your time on frivolity.",Cancer
"Jul 24, 2022 - You may be overwhelmed by an onslaught of communication from someone you didn't expect to hear from, Cancer. It could be that this person suddenly puts a monkey wrench in your plans. It's important to adapt and allow for the constant changes that are bound to come your way. Don't get so hung up on a certain way of doing things that you fail to see the wisdom in a new and different approach.",Cancer
"Jul 25, 2022 - If you aren't paying close attention today, Cancer, you might miss what's said. Important information is being relayed quickly, so don't miss out on the action. It may not be important for you to agree with everything you hear, but at least listen to it and seriously consider incorporating elements into your point of view. Don't dismiss other opinions just because they're new and different from your own.",Cancer
"Jul 26, 2022 - You may not understand what all the fuss is about today, Cancer. Suddenly there's a fire burning all around and you may be left questioning the motivations behind others' actions.

Take a hint from others that you may need to add a bit of spark to your life to spice things up a bit.",Cancer
"Jul 27, 2022 - Stick to the tried and true today, Cancer. Don't be afraid to make any last-minute changes of plan.

Celebrate the small things in life and appreciate all that you have - physically as well as emotionally. Let other people share in your warm and generous spirit.",Cancer
"Jul 28, 2022 - Be careful about being too critical today, Cancer. You're likely to turn people away if you aren't careful with how you express yourself. This is a good time to listen and receive as opposed to deliver information. Let things stew in your head for a while before you make any major decisions. You're likelier to find a greater balance in the situation if you slow down and back off a bit.",Cancer
"Jul 29, 2022 - There's a great deal of fun to be had today, Cancer. Money isn't always necessary to make this happen, however. In fact, money isn't a great way to keep score. Consider the sacrifices you make each time you strive to earn more cash. There's a dynamic feeling in the air today that's asking you to expand your mind in order to consider other ways to have fun.",Cancer
"Jul 30, 2022 - You've made progress these past few weeks, especially where your temper is concerned, Cancer. It has taken some effort, but it does seem that you can overcome your tendency to speak before thinking. Don't lose the ground you've gained. There's one person whose mission seems to be to make you explode. Don't let him or her rankle you. Take a deep breath and rise above it.",Cancer
"Jul 31, 2022 - This is a day to be up front with your partner, Cancer. It's possible that your relationship has reached some sort of stalemate. It's up to you to get that fire burning brightly once again. How? You know the drill - romantic time alone is all it takes. A nice outfit, a reservation at the best restaurant, and you and your mate are back in business.",Cancer
"Aug 1, 2022 - A war could be brewing in your world today, Cancer. Emotionally charged arguments shoot back and forth with conviction. Try not to get discouraged. Don't burn any bridges either. Remember that your words may fall on extremely sensitive ears, so use them with care. There's a very active part of your psyche that needs to be heard. Feel free to say your peace openly and honestly.",Cancer
"Aug 2, 2022 - You may be at a rather climactic point now in the department of love and beauty, Cancer. Your creative levels are peaking, and you might feel a strong urge to create something on a giant canvas. Realize that discipline is needed to get those artistic juices flowing. Don't let fear stop you. Initiate your dreams and let the details fall into place later.",Cancer
"Aug 3, 2022 - What seems like the perfect plan today may not necessarily seem like the perfect plan tomorrow, Cancer. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's working to catch you up in its net and pull you into its plan. Beware of get-rich-quick schemes. The wool could get pulled over your eyes on a day like this.",Cancer
"Aug 4, 2022 - A temporary delay in receiving some expected funds might force you to postpone a much-needed purchase, Cancer. Don't make yourself crazy over this. It isn't worth the stress. The delay is disheartening, but it isn't a cancellation. Your money will arrive, and you'll be able to go ahead with your plans. In the meantime, keep yourself busy. Hang in there.",Cancer
"Aug 5, 2022 - You may feel like a skipping record, Cancer. You've been scratched and mistreated, and now you continue to repeat the same thing over and over until you've driven your point home. This isn't your doing, so don't be concerned if you hear protests that you're sending others over the edge. This may be the very thing necessary for all of you to advance to the next step.",Cancer
"Aug 6, 2022 - Prepare for a surprise today, Cancer. Perhaps it will come from someone else or perhaps it will come from you. Either way, by evening you're apt to be feeling quite lovey-dovey and rather spaced out. Give in to the lethargic attitude that might sweep over you. This is your time to play, so put work aside and have a good time while letting your emotions dictate your actions.",Cancer
"Aug 7, 2022 - An unexpected letter could arrive today, Cancer, with a check enclosed, perhaps a gift, bonus, or offer to make more money. This might be a welcome break, possibly coming at a time when you really need it. If it's work, don't worry about the time involved. You'll be able to finish it quickly and efficiently. It might lead to more offers in the future.",Cancer
"Aug 8, 2022 - Pressure to get unfinished tasks completed and new ones begun causes emotions to run high, Cancer. Everyone, including you, is likely to feel tired and stressed, and quarrels may erupt. It might be best if you focus on the tasks at hand and ignore the petty squabbles that crop up around you. This will keep your blood pressure down and reassure those you want to impress.",Cancer
"Aug 9, 2022 - Someone is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues, Cancer, but this situation affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who the person is. Try to get them to open up without exerting pressure. Unfinished tasks could drive you crazy. You may try to race through them, which can cause too much stress. Get the crucial ones done and let the others go. Relax with a movie tonight.",Cancer
"Aug 10, 2022 - Emotional discussions with your partner could move you to tears, Cancer. You've overcome any difficulties and probably reached a new understanding. Any relationship or friendship started or advanced now shows promise of being strong and lasting. Your basic inclination will be to control your feelings, but don't be afraid to show them. It's OK at times like this.",Cancer
"Aug 11, 2022 - Have you wanted to move in a new direction, Cancer? If so, this could be when you get the lead of a lifetime. You might receive unexpected information indicating possible new sources of income to pursue on your own. New opportunities are going to come that could make a big difference in your lifestyle and catapult you to a higher socioeconomic bracket. Make the most of it all.",Cancer
"Aug 12, 2022 - Relations with family and other household members should be at their very best today, Cancer. If you see colleagues outside of work, they could also be congenial and supportive. This might stem from the fact that the lines of communication between you are wide open and you've reached a new understanding. Keep this going. It can only benefit everyone involved.",Cancer
"Aug 13, 2022 - Today you could recapture the joy in life that you had as a child, Cancer. You're serious by nature, and feelings of joy are to be lived and treasured. You could be experiencing true flow. There might not be any real reason for it, so don't try to find one. Your imagination and your relationships with others could be enhanced as a result. Relish the moment.",Cancer
"Aug 14, 2022 - Be happy with yourself and others, Cancer. Stop trying to find fault with everyone you interact with. By criticizing what they do and how they do it, you could wake up one morning and find that you have no friends. By only seeing the bad in people, you may talk yourself out of relationships with them. Be careful about coming across as a know-it-all. It isn't your job to dictate or judge.",Cancer
"Aug 15, 2022 - Don't judge someone just because his or her lifestyle differs from what you consider normal, Cancer. You may be traditional, but not everyone shares your view of relationships, work, or lifestyle. While this may seem hard to understand and even frightening to you, try not to be too hard on others. You'll be better off using that energy to keep your own life on track.",Cancer
"Aug 16, 2022 - See about using your good relationships with friends and loved ones to get future group activities going, Cancer. You're probably feeling great, and the idea of socializing appeals to you. See about inviting people over for supper or cards, when possible. If you're feeling especially lively, some sports may be just the ticket to get you moving. Do whatever it takes to have fun and get some fresh air safely.",Cancer
"Aug 17, 2022 - You might be really interested in getting out and doing something with the special people in your life, Cancer. You can thank the day's planetary aspects, which are conspiring to make this a perfect time to spend time together. Is there a place you're curious about and want to visit? Go today, if possible. Pack up the family and go for a fun day to check it out.",Cancer
"Aug 18, 2022 - You may find that today brings great physical strength and energy, Cancer. You may want to do some really challenging, physical work. This is the day for it, so why not go to it? Do some yard work or clean out closets, cupboards, drawers, and filing cabinets. Consider donating items that you don't use anymore or sell things online to make a couple bucks.",Cancer
"Aug 19, 2022 - Feed your mind with new knowledge, Cancer. Visit an internet bookstore or read some interesting information online. If you have more time, visit the library, if possible, or explore courses that you might like. There is knowledge to be had everywhere you look, provided you're open to receiving it. People are often the best resource. Ask someone to explain something, if that's what you need.",Cancer
"Aug 20, 2022 - With today's energy, you can take steps toward getting things in order, Cancer. Tackle desk drawers, closets, storage rooms, or filing cabinets. When you create order, you gain a sense of peace and personal control. Mental organization, such as goal planning, brainstorming, or scheduling, will add to this, too. Do what you can to clean out as many mental and physical corners as possible.",Cancer
"Aug 21, 2022 - There may be a great deal of fuss over something that seems quite insignificant to you, Cancer. Try to see the beauty and importance of everything around you. At the same time, make sure you give yourself enough credit for being the person you are. Egos are apt to go through a bit of a transformation that will affect the way you react to the outside world.",Cancer
"Aug 22, 2022 - Be careful that you aren't acting in a way that you dislike in others, Cancer. You could find that you're slowly taking on the traits of the people you despise. Lighten up a bit and put a smile on your face. If you continue to see the negative side of everything, it's likely that other people will only see the negative side of you.",Cancer
"Aug 23, 2022 - Today you might learn about new and creative ways to increase your income, Cancer, possibly involving technology in some way. So much new information could come your way that you find it hard to keep track of it, so make sure you take note of where you found it so you can consult the source later. Your mind could be going so fast that you need to take a walk to clear your head.",Cancer
"Aug 24, 2022 - Strange dreams, insights, or visions could upend your spiritual orientation, Cancer. These new ideas could have your mind going a thousand miles an hour and shake up concepts that you've embraced for most of your life. Think about it without making yourself crazy. What you're receiving is nothing more Earthshaking than information to consider and then accept or reject.",Cancer
"Aug 25, 2022 - Wake up on the right side of bed, Cancer. This will set the tone for the rest of the day. Keep things positive and you'll find that the aggressive energies of the day work for instead of against you. Don't try to fight people who are so obstinate that they refuse to see another perspective. At the same time, make sure you stay open to other people's points of view.",Cancer
"Aug 26, 2022 - There's a lighthearted, whimsical quality about the day that you might not appreciate at first, Cancer. You'll find that the more open and accepting you are of this energy, the more you can make it work positively for you. Use this feeling to balance the seriousness in your day. Don't get caught up in unnecessary drama that has nothing to do with your situation.",Cancer
"Aug 27, 2022 - Tact isn't necessarily your strong suit, Cancer. No one would accuse you of being overly sensitive to other people's emotions, but today you turn over a new leaf. This ""new and improved"" you tunes in to the thoughts and feelings of others and responds in thoughtful, caring ways. You may be surprised at how effective this gentler touch can be.",Cancer
"Aug 28, 2022 - The need to attend to business or networking obligations disguised as parties could get to you today, Cancer. You may have been forced to attend too many of these recently, and now there are even more coming up. You dread going to a place you don't want to go, eating food you hate, talking pleasantly with people you can't stand. Decline if you can. Life's too short.",Cancer
"Aug 29, 2022 - Today you might attend a virtual group event of some kind involving your neighborhood, Cancer, possibly with a partner. You and your friend might take an active part in discussing goals for the group. You feel strongly bonded to everyone - your partner, fellow group members, even the community. It's a warm, fuzzy feeling that could stay with you all evening.",Cancer
"Aug 30, 2022 - You may find that someone or something is thinking or working opposite to the way you are, Cancer. This feeling is aggravated even more by a strong warrior force that wants to be recognized. There is definitely a squeaky wheel in the situation that desperately needs oiling. Take care of the basics first before you try to deal with the particulars of a certain situation.",Cancer
"Aug 31, 2022 - You're especially in tune with the environment and the people around you today, Cancer. Such sensitivity is new to you, and you aren't exactly sure what to do with the myriad messages that come into your head, seemingly out of nowhere. Even though this is outside your usual experience, try to accept rather than analyze.",Cancer
"Sep 1, 2022 - It could be hard to find your footing early in the day, Cancer. You may be better off sleeping in. Have a good breakfast and relax in the morning. By evening, you'll be refreshed, recharged, and ready to take on the town. Your emotions may feel restricted, which could make it difficult to fully express yourself. You'd be better off turning this energy inward now.",Cancer
"Sep 2, 2022 - The special someone in your life may be having some trouble with colleagues. Don't just comfort him or her, Cancer. It's unlikely that your sweetie wants sympathy. Solutions are needed. If you don't have any, just be a good listener. It's important for you to get out and exercise. If the weather is good, take a walk. If not, attend an online exercise class. You'll feel better.",Cancer
"Sep 3, 2022 - Finances could take on a new dimension as you look to technology to help you increase your bank balance. You could decide to invest online or try some new means of recordkeeping. Whatever you try will bode well for your financial future. Expect a lucky break or two as well.",Cancer
"Sep 4, 2022 - It isn't a good idea to talk behind other people's backs today, Cancer. If you have an issue with someone in particular, bring it up to that person directly. This isn't a good time to gossip. Maintaining trust is extremely important right now. This attitude will open many doors for you. Believe that the more you love others, the more love will be returned to you.",Cancer
"Sep 5, 2022 - If you happen to be thinking about a particular friend today, Cancer, don't be surprised if you hear from him or her. You're especially attuned to telepathic messages, and you may send out a few. While you usually enjoy solitude, you might be more interested in communicating with others today. Don't fight the urge. Go for it. You could talk to some interesting new people who become your friends for life.",Cancer
"Sep 6, 2022 - Today you might earn corporate kudos, Cancer, for all signs indicate that your imagination is flying high and can be put to work to increase your job effectiveness. You might even earn a promotion or increase in salary. However, it's important to curb the impulse to hide the downside of whatever you're doing from those in power. Be honest! It will benefit you more in the long run.",Cancer
"Sep 7, 2022 - Worries over the situation of a lover or close friend who seems depressed could plague you today, yet you may hesitate to contact this person and ask what's wrong because you don't want to intrude. Nonetheless, you should. All is not as bad as it seems, and your concern will be appreciated. Tonight, get some much-needed rest. You've been working far too hard.",Cancer
"Sep 8, 2022 - Realize that you might have to leave some things to chance today, because you probably aren't going to be able to control all that you'd like to under the circumstances, Cancer. Although it may be comfortable for you to try to fit things into their perfect spots, you'll find that this may not be the best way to conduct your business, especially on a day like this.",Cancer
"Sep 9, 2022 - You could be feeling a bit antsy today and may want to spend time exercising or trying a new sport or game that you've never played before. This is great. Ask some friends to join you, if possible. Don't push yourself past your limits. This can only bring exhaustion or injury, and it won't help your fitness level. Exercise within your limitations and do it more often.",Cancer
"Sep 10, 2022 - There are lots of personal and financial issues to resolve today, Cancer. You may hear from your bank or see some alarming numbers on an ATM receipt. Don't get upset. Ultimately, these matters will be resolved to your benefit. As for personal matters, you may learn some new information about someone you thought you knew well. A relationship you once considered close may not be.",Cancer
"Sep 11, 2022 - Recent successes could lead to new aspirations to increase your socioeconomic standing. You should be feeling especially determined and confident about your future. Your plans have worked out well. You're feeling close to family, as your intuition level is high, and you can sense what they're thinking and feeling. Career and relationships look promising. Enjoy!",Cancer
"Sep 12, 2022 - An organization with which you're affiliated may be having financial problems, and this fact could come out today. It might be a shock to you and everyone else involved, Cancer, but it's good that it's coming out now. This revelation might have a profound effect on your goals, and may necessitate some reevaluation. Some intense discussion with those around you is definitely indicated.",Cancer
"Sep 13, 2022 - Expect something new to take place regarding your home today, Cancer. A family member could come for a visit or even move in. You could be redecorating, landscaping, or buying new furniture. There is always the possibility that you're moving. Whatever the changes, they're likely to be positive despite the messy and disruptive process of making them. You've got a lot to look forward to!",Cancer
"Sep 14, 2022 - Make sure you're getting enough sleep, Cancer. You may seem groggy and your head could be a bit cloudy today, but try not to let this stop you from getting your work done. Much of what you perceive may not exactly correlate with reality. Your emotions could be especially distorted. You may have a strong desire to escape into a fantasy world. Try to keep both feet on the ground.",Cancer
"Sep 15, 2022 - Put your businesslike nature aside for the day and focus on your feelings, Cancer. You may be a bit protective of your emotions, but realize that much of what you're feeling is best experienced through expressing it to others. Reach down deep and get in touch with what you truly believe to be the heart of the issue. Your thinking is clear as can be today, so enjoy it!",Cancer
"Sep 16, 2022 - A conversation with someone in your neighborhood could prove unexpectedly pleasant and enjoyable. You might meet new people and get closer to the ones you already know.

You might also lend or borrow some books today.",Cancer
"Sep 17, 2022 - You tend to be down to Earth and practical, Cancer, but now you feel like indulging in some flights of fancy. Romance or fantasy novels could be especially appealing right now. You might even toy with the idea of writing one of your own. If you're currently romantically involved, your sweetheart might want to do something special with you tonight. Enjoy your day.",Cancer
"Sep 18, 2022 - Invaluable help with money or property concerns could come to you from an unexpected quarter today, Cancer.

The situation may not be all that dire to begin with, but all should be well by day's end.",Cancer
"Sep 19, 2022 - It's time to take a bold step forward, Cancer. Have confidence in yourself and all the careful planning you've been painstakingly doing for the past few months. Realize that much of this hard work is paying off, but only if you're willing to take the next step. The opportunity is there. All you need to do is jump on it. Act out of faith and confidence instead of fear and restriction.",Cancer
"Sep 20, 2022 - A chance to increase your income by participating in an artistic project of some kind could come your way today, Cancer. You might take part in the creative work or you could promote it in a business capacity. Whichever it is, you're likely to form some firm friendships in the process. If you're single, one of your colleagues might turn out to be a potential love partner. Enjoy!",Cancer
"Sep 21, 2022 - Spiritual breakthroughs may have you feeling a little disconcerted, Cancer. Clearing away deadwood, such as past traumas, might tell you a few things about yourself you'd rather not face. It's vital to release them in order to progress as a human being. Even if tears are involved, this is a positive development. You'll feel happier once it's all set free. Onward and upward!",Cancer
"Sep 22, 2022 - You're highly esteemed in your profession because of your strong business acumen and no-nonsense approach to problem solving. Recent successes may be preparing you for the next leap in the progression. Be open to opportunities involving the Internet that present themselves. Remember, there's no glass ceiling online. Today may be peppered with all sorts of communications from friends.",Cancer
"Sep 23, 2022 - Today you might discover a previously untapped talent, Cancer, perhaps an artistic gift. This could be thrilling, but it will probably take some getting used to. Your first efforts might be tentative and uncertain, but this is what usually happens when you learn a new skill. Don't get discouraged yet! Give yourself time. Eventually you'll probably love what you do.",Cancer
"Sep 24, 2022 - A quick check of your bank balance might reveal that it's a bit lower than you expected, Cancer. You probably won't panic, but you're apt to feel a little disappointed. Don't waste time kicking yourself. Money can always be earned. Relax, resolve to tighten your belt a little, take care of the necessities, and stick with a financial plan. Soon you'll be glad you took action.",Cancer
"Sep 25, 2022 - Be your most charming self tonight, Cancer. You're likely to talk with someone who can help your career.

Whether this person impacts your life in a romantic or business capacity, you'll remember this night as when your life changed for the better!",Cancer
"Sep 26, 2022 - Some books you've been reading lately might excite your desire to study astrology, numerology, alchemy, or some other occult science, Cancer. This may not be something that you'd normally consider, but don't let that hold you back. Your values have been shaken up lately anyway, so make the most of the impulse now. It could transform you in a subtle way. Go for it!",Cancer
"Sep 27, 2022 - You're generally focused on the material world, Cancer, but something about the energy generated by today's planetary alignments causes you to look within. You might think about the joys and pains of past family gatherings and wonder how they affect your life now. This is a positive, healing process, so don't fight it. It won't interfere with what's going on around you.",Cancer
"Sep 28, 2022 - Have you been indulging in too many goodies, Cancer? You might feel under the weather because of all this abundance. You probably should take it easy. Think about reorganizing your priorities. Is a second piece of chocolate cake more important than your energy and health? Indulging can be important to your psyche, but don't forget about moderation - and don't forget that there are many other ways to indulge.",Cancer
"Sep 29, 2022 - You could be feeling quite lazy today, Cancer, and you definitely deserve to feel this way! You deserve some time off after all of the activities of the past week. Give yourself the gift of a true day off. Do only what you want, whether it's watching movies or spending the afternoon soaking in the tub. Total indulgence. Just relax and unwind.",Cancer
"Sep 30, 2022 - You're a person of many talents, and today you're likely to discover yet another one, Cancer. The delivery of a new piece of equipment makes you feel like you've been given a toy for your sole enjoyment. But once you get the computer or piece of machinery up and running, you need to share it with your co-workers! They will be very impressed with your technical abilities.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Oct 1, 2022 - If you've asked your employer for a raise recently, Cancer, the astral energy indicates that you can expect to receive one soon.

Opportunities may certainly appear, although this is obviously not the time to decide. Take some time to really think and consider everything carefully.",Cancer
"Oct 2, 2022 - Be a pioneer thinker today, Cancer. There's a noble courage in your thoughts, so don't let this quality go to waste.

Feel free to brainstorm bold ways to execute this plan.",Cancer
"Oct 3, 2022 - Keep careful track of things today, Cancer, for you will find that the smallest detail will make the biggest difference.

Trust yourself regardless of what's going on around you.",Cancer
"Oct 4, 2022 - It may seem like everyone around you is happy and getting what they want while you're stuck in the trenches, Cancer. Don't compare yourself to other people and make judgments based on outside appearances. The truth of the matter is that they're most likely only looking at the immediate future and experiencing short-term pleasures. You, however, have your sights set on the long-term and will probably be much better off.",Cancer
"Oct 5, 2022 - Contact with a friend's may have to be delayed, and this might worry you. It will be necessary to make a special effort to get almost anything done today, Cancer.

You don't want to put anything off now.",Cancer
"Oct 6, 2022 - You may be confused when it comes to matters of the heart, Cancer. Perhaps you feel cheated when the object of your desire doesn't give you complete attention at all times. The fundamental security of your being is your responsibility, not someone else's. Find a way to incorporate your dreams into the dreams of others instead of always working toward goals at opposite sides of the spectrum.",Cancer
"Oct 7, 2022 - Things should be going quite well for you today, Cancer, and you will find that aspects of your life that may have felt disconnected in the past are finally slipping into place. Have faith that all your painstaking planning and organizing is finally going to pay off. This is especially true in love and romance. Spend intimate time with a close partner tonight if possible.",Cancer
"Oct 8, 2022 - Water your plants today and make sure they're getting enough light, Cancer. If you don't have any plants, take this opportunity to go to the nursery and pick up a couple for your home or office. Nourish the organic things in your life to help remind you of your own roots, which are extremely important for you right now. Sink deep into the Earth in order to understand the environment around you.",Cancer
"Oct 9, 2022 - When tension builds, your sense of security is likely to falter, Cancer. You may have a hard time dealing with other people. You could be tempted to turn to food or alcohol for inner nourishment. Curing emotional needs by indulging this way may temper your ailment for a while, but it isn't the solution to the overall problem. Work out the bugs with the people involved, and don't try to do it on an empty stomach.",Cancer
"Oct 10, 2022 - Have you been spending too much lately, Cancer? Today you could be feeling the effects of it. You may have to wait to make a purchase that you've wanted for a long time, and this could be frustrating. Don't worry about it, though.

Celebrate just being together in whatever way you can!",Cancer
"Oct 13, 2022 - It's likely that your personal and creative horizons are expanding, Cancer. Your or another's artistic enterprises might pay off big today. You could be introduced to people who prove to be valuable contacts as well as new friends. Your love relationships are going well. Your new feeling of enthusiasm and self-confidence certainly doesn't hurt!",Cancer
"Oct 14, 2022 - If you find yourself tired and irritable at the moment, Cancer, you should know that this is normal. You may have had a few weeks that were a little too studious. Would you like to continue on the same path? Be careful that your ambitions don't lead you to serious physical exhaustion, Cancer. You'll be even more frustrated if you get sick. So be wise and take care of your basic needs.",Cancer
"Oct 15, 2022 - A legal matter that may have been pending for a while could finally be completed today, Cancer. It's very likely to go in your favor. Therefore, if you've been sitting on a contract, agreement, or other document that needs your signature, read it carefully before you sign. You will probably get what you want out of the transaction. By the way, this is also a great day to get married!",Cancer
"Oct 16, 2022 - You might be frustrated by the fact that people are doing things hastily today, Cancer. You might have to accept the fast-paced energy of the day just so you can keep up. Don't worry if you engage in activities that aren't carefully planned beforehand. You will find spontaneous frivolity to be extremely rewarding on a day like this. Expect the unexpected.",Cancer
"Oct 17, 2022 - Your mind might be stimulated today, Cancer, so stay alert and open to new information. If you feel tired, take a short nap. It's better to operate at top speed and full capacity than go through your day only half present. Don't rely on external stimulants like caffeine to pick you up. These things will deceive your body and do damage to your nervous system.",Cancer
"Oct 18, 2022 - I told you so might be your motto of the day. Try not to rub this in other people's faces, Cancer. Indeed, you have the foresight to witness an action and see the consequences right away. These consequences might rear their ugly heads on a day like this. Use your incredible perception and intuition to home in on the best solution possible and work toward that goal before things get out of hand.",Cancer
"Oct 19, 2022 - Your plans meet with harsh opposition today, Cancer. You've been going along at a slow and steady pace, but you will find that abrasive tension arises the more you try to force your will on others. Gridlock is quite likely due to the fact that there are strong forces coming to a head. Neither one of them is in the mood to yield now.",Cancer
"Oct 20, 2022 - Communicate from a centered space today, Cancer. Fortunately, the nature of the day caters to your needs and desires. You shouldn't have to work too hard to get what you want. Things should come to you naturally. You may wonder why you got stressed out before over what now seem to be small issues. Consciously release the worry and concern that are still stored in your body.",Cancer
"Oct 21, 2022 - Put on some lively music you can dance to and really kick up your heels, Cancer. It's time to put away the sour mood and have fun. You will find that the more you engage in intellectual discussions with people today, the more you will get warmed up to the idea that life should be fun, not the pain and stress you sometimes make it out to be.",Cancer
"Oct 22, 2022 - Some failures that you may have experienced over the past few days could have you beating yourself up today, Cancer. Perhaps you feel that you were too hasty or too sloppy and could have done things better. Don't obsess over it. Figure out what went wrong, learn from it, and let it go. Too much negativity directed at yourself is likely to sabotage future efforts rather than help them.",Cancer
"Oct 23, 2022 - A small gathering may take place in your neighborhood today if at all possible, Cancer. If you're currently involved, you will probably attend it with your significant other. If you aren't seeing anyone, you will run into some old friends and possibly make some new ones. One of them could be a potential love interest, perhaps a little older than you. Relax, let loose, and have a little fun.",Cancer
"Oct 24, 2022 - Unexpected money developments could brighten your day today, Cancer. Perhaps you will get a raise or an increase in some other form of income. Technology could be involved in some way, or a long-term goal you've been striving for finally brings in some benefits. There might be uncertainty about when it's coming or exactly how much it will be, but the outcome will be gratifying all the same!",Cancer
"Oct 25, 2022 - Financial issues might have you and your partner a bit more on edge than you need to be, Cancer. Perhaps money is tighter than usual right now, and you have to put off purchases you want to make. Try to work it out. This is a great day to reach a compromise in just about any touchy situation, because you should be in just the right space to see both sides of any issue.",Cancer
"Oct 26, 2022 - One of your ambitions in life is to be financially independent, and lately you might have made great strides toward attaining that goal. Today, through no fault of your own, you may receive information that indicates there may have been a setback. However, all is not as it seems. Don't go into a panic until you know all the facts, Cancer. You're probably still right on track.",Cancer
"Oct 27, 2022 - You're feeling especially sharp, Cancer. Your thoughts are more focused than usual and your mind especially penetrating. A promised get-together with friends or loved ones may have to be delayed, but it will take place. Information about possible business opportunities could come through periodicals, and if you like them, check them out. The outlook on anything that comes your way today is especially bright.",Cancer
"Oct 28, 2022 - Extra time and attention that you have been devoting to your career should pay off about now. You've worked hard to be where you are, and you aren't through climbing the ladder of success just yet. You aren't likely to rest on your laurels. Today you might spend a lot of time planning your next goal. A little ingenuity will definitely pay off here, Cancer. Use whatever advantages you have.",Cancer
"Oct 29, 2022 - A love relationship seems more stable than usual today, Cancer. The security wraps itself around you like a blanket as you consider the events leading up to this new sense of commitment. You and your partner may spend the evening doing nothing more than being together, which feels great! Mark this day in your memory so you can recall it whenever your insecurities get the better of you.",Cancer
"Oct 30, 2022 - As you take another step upward today, Cancer, you may realize that there's a large part of the mountain you hadn't accounted for before. Perhaps this steep portion of the climb wasn't visible from below when you started the trip. Don't panic. By overreacting to the unknown, you may lose your balance and go sliding down the face of the mountain. Collect yourself, rest, and plan your strategy one step at a time.",Cancer
"Oct 31, 2022 - It's time to take your communication to the next level, Cancer. Expand outward and upward. For the last three weeks you've gone through a serious mental process that has helped you define what you stand for and believe in. Now you're in a phase that urges you to put these ideas into motion. The expansive quality of the day is profound, so take advantage of it and get moving.",Cancer
"Nov 1, 2022 - There is irony in today's situation, Cancer. The only real remedy for situations like this is to accept them and joke about it. If you try to take yourself too seriously, especially when it comes to art or romance, you will inevitably fail. Your heart is sensual and your emotions profound. Bring yourself into balance by laughing instead of crying about the events of the day.",Cancer
"Nov 2, 2022 - Short visits in your neighborhood could catapult you into some negative situations, Cancer. It's best to stay close to home if you can. An angry letter or call could put you in a shaky mood. This isn't a day to socialize. Days like this are best spent keeping to yourself and throwing your energy into taking care of whatever you're working on.",Cancer
"Nov 3, 2022 - Cancer, you hide your emotional needs from others. You need to be able to trust someone in order to share your feeling. They have to guess at your deepest secrets. Today you could save a lot of time in your love life if you just tell your partner what you want out of your relationship or even what you'd like to change about it. Talk about it. Your partner is listening.",Cancer
"Nov 4, 2022 - Today's planetary configurations indicate that you can expect a very profitable period coming up, Cancer. You've worked hard lately, and it's only natural that you should finally arrive at this stage. You're going to be able to measure the distance you've come, and above all, evaluate your power. Whatever you do, think big!",Cancer
"Nov 5, 2022 - This is a very spiritual and creative day for you, Cancer. You're especially intuitive. Any creative effort will likely resonate deeply. Even if you don't feel you have the talent for it, why not try some form of artistic expression? You could dabble with a paintbrush or makes notes in a journal. Don't let that pesky internal editor kick in. Create for the sheer joy of it.",Cancer
"Nov 6, 2022 - It isn't a good idea to try to fit people into a mold today, Cancer. This will only annoy others and frustrate you. It's important that you relax and simply let people blossom into the people they want to be. If you have a preconceived notion of who they should be, you're only setting yourself up for failure and disappointment, as well as anger from the other party.",Cancer
"Nov 7, 2022 - It's important that you abandon the myth that you don't have any gifts or talents, Cancer. Consider thinking about your talents in the same way you think about your body. When you exercise, eat right, and get plenty of rest, your body responds. Your talents are no different. They need care and nurturing, too.",Cancer
"Nov 8, 2022 - Yes, Cancer, this is a good moment to abandon old beliefs and moral values. Your view of life has changed and, above all, you're more aware of how your outdated, preconceived ideas sometimes poison your life. The past no longer concerns you. It's time for you to make a clean break from the beliefs that are holding you back. You might shock your family, but they'll get over it.",Cancer
"Nov 9, 2022 - It isn't always easy to think about how your life is going, Cancer. Imagine if you were alone in the world, with nothing to hold you back or force you to do anything. At least once a month dedicate an hour to visualizing what your life would be like under these conditions. This will help you figure out what's impeding you today.",Cancer
"Nov 10, 2022 - Even if it's true in general that Cancer have strong bodies like you, there are times when it's important that they take care of themselves. This would be an ideal day to be more aware of that fact. It isn't that you're going to have health problems. Rather, the planets are positioned in the middle of abundant activity, suggesting that you'd be wise to take care of your body - your greatest asset.",Cancer
"Nov 11, 2022 - You may feel yourself slipping into a deeper understanding with a close friend or loved one, Cancer. Romantic situations are heating up, and you're slowly letting your inhibitions fade away so they're completely absent. You realize the exuberance and excitement that come when you come out of hiding and let your playful spirit charm the world. Put serious subjects aside and make time to have fun and be more social.",Cancer
"Nov 12, 2022 - Your sense of responsibility is probably the catalyst for most of your motivation, Cancer. But what happens when events are beyond your control and you're powerless to do anything about them? You may have to admit that sometimes you can't control everything, especially your family and friends. Today you should think about letting things happen occasionally. Your life will be a lot less complicated.",Cancer
"Nov 13, 2022 - A lot of activity could occur at home today, Cancer. Perhaps you will have visitors or do some work on the house. Your intuition is particularly strong right now, and you could pick up too much of the thoughts and feelings of others, even strangers. You will probably be most in tune with your family. Take care to guard your thoughts. Today you might find that whatever you think of could actually manifest.",Cancer
"Nov 14, 2022 - Today you might hear of opportunities to make extra money through creative work of some kind, Cancer. This could be a genuine lucky break achieved by being in the right place at the right time. You will probably take advantage of it, because right now you're full of inspiration. You might have a hard time keeping track of all your ideas. Write them down!",Cancer
"Nov 15, 2022 - With today's energy, you might want to let your imagination run free for a while, Cancer. This can add a real boost, as it will connect you with your inner self. Let your imagination be your ticket to your creative and artistic abilities. Problem-solving skills can also be accented or realized when the mind has time to roam. This part of you is as important as your heart, so use it to the fullest.",Cancer
"Nov 16, 2022 - If someone takes too long to do something today, Cancer, your temper may flare up. Patience isn't always your strong suit, and you may believe in the ""if you want it done right, do it yourself"" philosophy. This isn't always fair. Others need to do things at their own pace, and in some cases, it's essential that you give them the room to do so. Take a deep breath if you have to, and be patient.",Cancer
"Nov 17, 2022 - Your emotions are solid, and you feel good, Cancer. At the same time, you may be tongue-tied. You're having a hard time expressing your true feelings in the way you'd like to, especially when it comes to love and romance. Perhaps you have so many thoughts that you don't know how to sort them out, or which to disclose and which to keep hidden.",Cancer
"Nov 18, 2022 - Cancer, you're demystifying the concept of talent. You used to look enviously at other people and think, ""I wish I had a natural ability like that."" Now you understand that the person who aroused your envy with is just someone who had the self-confidence to go to work and refine and develop an aptitude. It's a matter of hard work, belief in oneself, and bravery in the face of risk. You can do it, too!",Cancer
"Nov 19, 2022 - Lately, you've been nursing a feeling that your partner is inattentive. The tension has been building up and today, Cancer, you're likely to boil over with the rage that comes from one too many doubts and suspicions. The forecast for love is stormy, without a doubt. But making up after the quarrel promises to be lots of fun.",Cancer
"Nov 20, 2022 - There's some likelihood that something you need or want has been eluding your grasp. The somewhat strained aspect of the heavens lately hasn't helped. But today everything is within reach, especially if it was material considerations holding you back. You have an auspicious day ahead, so make the most of it!",Cancer
"Nov 21, 2022 - Have you been thinking about expanding your computer skills? If so, this is the day to do it. You're likely to discover a lot of valuable information, as well as shortcuts for accomplishing your goals. Happiness reigns in the home as family members exchange a lot of new and interesting ideas. This could be a very gratifying day in a lot of ways, Cancer.",Cancer
"Nov 22, 2022 - This is the end of the first stage in your ""socialization,"" Cancer. Are you satisfied with the people you've met? You can usually make the most out of these encounters, but did your political savvy let you down? Did it lead you in directions you didn't want to go? Take advantage of this pause to catch your breath and figure out where you are today and where you want to be tomorrow.",Cancer
"Nov 23, 2022 - Today may be one of those days in which you're trying to paint a large area, but you only have a small brush. Your strokes are careful and calculated. You're doing a neat and precise job, but you're also doing things the hard way. Go easy on yourself and get a large brush. Make your strokes gigantic so you can cover more area with less effort.",Cancer
"Nov 24, 2022 - You might not have heard from a close friend in a long time and worry a little, Cancer. Perhaps this person wasn't well the last time you talked. If you can, it might be a good idea to call. Strange and unsettling dreams could plague your sleep tonight, but don't get too agitated. They aren't prophetic in any way. The symbols probably represent nothing more than psychic detritus released through sleep.",Cancer
"Nov 25, 2022 - Now is the perfect time to say something to someone that you've been meaning to say for quite some time, Cancer. Get it out in the open. Keeping it inside will only eat away at you. Stop worrying about the consequences and make the move. Today is the time to be bold and aggressive. Other people might respond in a similar fashion, so if you dish it out, be prepared to take it.",Cancer
"Nov 26, 2022 - A friend or family member is slowly poisoning your relationship, Cancer. A misunderstanding between the two of you will ultimately prove beneficial in the long run. Why? It makes you realize how uncomfortable you are with vague, ill-defined relationships. Today would be a good day to write a letter to the person in question. You're likely to find the results gratifying.",Cancer
"Nov 27, 2022 - You're rarely surprised or bothered by the occasional setback. Today, however, you should put a firm hand on any project you undertake. This isn't the time for a relaxed attitude, especially where money is concerned. If you take a systematic approach, you will have the double benefit of conserving both energy and assets.",Cancer
"Nov 28, 2022 - Make sure you solidify your affairs early in the day, Cancer, because the sparks are going to fly after sunset. People might try to throw you off balance with fast talk and fancy ideas. You need to make sure you're on solid ground before you take the next step upward. Balance your emotions so you don't take your frustration out on others. Focus on your goals.",Cancer
"Nov 29, 2022 - You may find it hard to get rolling today, Cancer. It's likely that you're caught in a gridlock between your mind and heart. Be careful about letting this tension build. The most important thing for you today is to relax. Tackle things one step at a time and finish one project before starting another. You could get overwhelmed if you have too many things on your plate at once.",Cancer
"Nov 30, 2022 - If you find yourself tired and irritable now, Cancer, you should know that this is normal. You may have had a few months that were a little too studious. Would you like to continue with the same rhythm? Be careful that your ambitions don't lead you to physical exhaustion. If you get sick, you will be even more frustrated. So be wise and take care of your own basic needs.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Cancer, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",Cancer
"Dec 1, 2022 - A quarrel over money could interfere with a friendship today, Cancer. Perhaps someone hasn't repaid a loan and the lender now needs it. Perhaps a member of your household is unable to pay their share of the bills. Don't let yourself get drawn into quarrels or recriminations. Work something out with your friend if possible. Money isn't worth throwing away a friendship and leaving a gap in your life.",Cancer
"Dec 2, 2022 - Don't let other people's insensitive actions dictate your mood today, Cancer. Your state of mind is your responsibility, and you should work to come to a point at which you have full control over what you feel at all times. If something isn't working out, let it go. This isn't a good time to try to stick a square peg in a round hole.",Cancer
"Dec 3, 2022 - Lock into the practical, grounding force that is not only realistic but also flexible. Attend to details and organize yourself, Cancer. Be aware that you may need to alter your course in order to fit with the group energy. Try to work together with those around you to achieve a common goal. Initiating the help of others is easier than you think as long as you stay focused and motivated.",Cancer
"Dec 4, 2022 - There may be a thousand things for you to do today, Cancer, but you can only get them done if you concentrate on one at a time. Take a lighthearted approach. You will never finish by focusing on the sheer amount of work you have to do. Break it up into smaller pieces and delegate tasks if you can. Try to see the fun side of things. Schedule in breaks and snacks.",Cancer
"Dec 5, 2022 - Try to see the positive in people, Cancer. Relax and don't get so worked up over your internal drama. You're the one responsible for creating this turmoil. Find comfort in a creative project. Do something that you love to do that makes you truly happy. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's likely to amplify whatever mood you project.",Cancer
"Dec 6, 2022 - There are days when you feel wonderful without being able to attribute the feeling to any real event. Of course, your rational mind will search for a reason for your happiness. But if you count the number of times when you do things against your will, it becomes obvious that logic and reason don't always apply to this world. Don't even try to understand. Just enjoy!",Cancer
"Dec 7, 2022 - You may be planning for the future, Cancer, yet find yourself needing to make choices that will resonate far beyond the next few months. It's possible that you will have to consider sending your children to a new school, for example, or decide to move across the country. These are big decisions, to be sure, but trust that you won't be making them alone. Your loved ones have a say in these matters!",Cancer
"Dec 8, 2022 - Today, Cancer, you probably aren't going to feel very friendly. You're most likely to want to sequester yourself at home and not see or speak to anyone. If your need for solitude is that strong, indulge it. You won't do yourself any good by forcing contact with others. You might feel a little out of sorts physically, so it's especially important to eat right and get lots of vitamin C.",Cancer
"Dec 9, 2022 - Dreams of a new career could fill your mind today, perhaps because of too much stress in your current one. You might even think of becoming a movie star! Go for your dream if you feel it's what you want, Cancer. Remember that any moneymaking enterprise, no matter how creative, is still a business. Make use of your natural business talent to find out what you need to know.",Cancer
"Dec 10, 2022 - Your practicality and good sense prove invaluable today, Cancer. Those close to you might be restless and upset, and you might have to steer them in the right direction. A close friend or lover may experience a financial upset, and you could be asked to help out. This isn't a good day to make a loan, although it's favorable for helping others find their own solutions.",Cancer
"Dec 11, 2022 - Take pressing matters to the hilt today, Cancer, especially when it comes to romantic issues and emotional needs. You have all the data you need to make a valid point. You have a whole battalion of facts to back you up, so fire at will. Your feelings are strong and intense. Don't ignored them under any circumstances. Go with your gut instincts before you trust anything else.",Cancer
"Dec 12, 2022 - Your thoughts may have a dreamy quality today, Cancer. You will find that things are less stable than they have been for the past few days. Don't get discouraged by pessimistic people. Offer your own creative solutions. You have a great deal of wisdom to share with others whether you realize it or not. Don't sell yourself short. Have confidence in your thoughts and ideas.",Cancer
"Dec 13, 2022 - Stand up and take action, Cancer. Forces may be pulling on you from all angles, and your challenge will be to maintain a healthy balance among all of them. You have a chance to accomplish a great deal by directing your energies outward instead of inward. Other people may be punchy. Counteract this by being patient. Your contribution to the group will be appreciated.",Cancer
"Dec 14, 2022 - Egos may rage out of control today, leaving you to wonder what all the fuss is about. Give other people their space, Cancer. If the conversation gets too boring, just smile and nod. There may be a great deal of tension among people who are fighting about how much they can get versus how much they give. Try to maintain a healthy balance. Don't get caught in other people's drama.",Cancer
"Dec 15, 2022 - You might find it hard to connect with anyone on a deep and meaningful level today, Cancer, so just free yourself and have a good time. Take a more refined and disciplined approach to your projects. You will find that you can be productive after sundown. Later you should consider snuggling up close to someone you trust and care about deeply.",Cancer
"Dec 16, 2022 - Go ahead and act confidently, Cancer. You will probably find that you're more stable and grounded in general, leaving you free to explore and take more risks than you normally would. Your intuition may be strong, so don't hesitate to rely on it. Make sure your actions are clear and decisive. You have a great deal of power, so use it wisely.",Cancer
"Dec 17, 2022 - Other people may be demanding of you, Cancer, so do what you can to please them. Don't go overboard in thinking you need to be someone you're not, and certainly don't do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Be generous with your affection, but make sure you receive emotional support in return. There are likely to be some imbalances that need minor adjustments.",Cancer
"Dec 18, 2022 - There may be tension in the air as you go about your day, Cancer. The leftover fatigue from the past few days is starting to wear on you. You may have managed to get into an argument with someone close to you, but there might be a reason for this. Take advantage of the situation to clear the air with your friend.",Cancer
"Dec 19, 2022 - You will be busy today, Cancer. Nevertheless, you still may end the day with your desk piled high with projects - not because you're unproductive, but rather because you're popular and your work is valued. You may be wishing you weren't quite so valuable! Don't get stressed about all you have to do. No one expects you to get it all done immediately. Get some rest. Tomorrow is another day.",Cancer
"Dec 20, 2022 - Cancer, you may put your integrity under the microscope today. We all have deep convictions that we would never let go of. But society pressures us, and it isn't always easy to live in perfect harmony with our ideals. The question to ask yourself today is just how willing are you to change your most heartfelt beliefs in order to live in society? Do you have the courage of your convictions?",Cancer
"Dec 21, 2022 - Try not to see the negative in everything today, Cancer. Concentrate on the positive. You will pick up subtle signals from others that can be very helpful as you gather data throughout the day. As you proceed through it, keep in mind that everything need not be a race to the finish line. Enjoy where you are now. There's no reason to rush to the next activity if you're having fun.",Cancer
"Dec 22, 2022 - Tension may run high today as things come to a great emotional climax. It might seem as if everyone is out to get you, Cancer, but more than likely this paranoia is a figment of your imagination. Don't get carried away with crazy scenarios that have no basis in reality. People may be acting irrationally, so don't be surprised if reason and logic are nowhere to be found.",Cancer
"Dec 23, 2022 - You're usually very good at concentrating and getting your chores done, even when chaos reigns around you. This likely won't be the case today. Even you will come under the influence of the erratic. It's too hard to get much done with all the commotion. Don't fret about your lack of productivity. This is one day. Relax and have some fun. Tomorrow you can get down to work.",Cancer
"Dec 24, 2022 - Remember all those resolutions you made in the past? It's time to recommit to them. All signs indicate that you need to take better care of yourself. You've been so busy working that exercising has begun to feel like a luxury you can't afford. Actually, exercise and proper nutrition are luxuries you can't afford to ignore. You're burning the candle at both ends. Stop before you burn out completely!",Cancer
"Dec 25, 2022 - You may not feel like you're in tune with your situation today, Cancer. Try not to get too pushy with your opinions about how things should be done. Honor other people's perspectives and approaches. It may be hard for others to commit to things the same way you do. Their methods may be different, but that doesn't mean they are necessarily any better or worse.",Cancer
"Dec 26, 2022 - This is a terrific day for you, Cancer. You will feel a greater sense of appreciation and respect for the people around you. The planning and hard work you've contributed recently is finally paying off. People are likely to arrive at your level of thinking. You'll find you can connect on a very productive level. Your emotions are under control and your thoughts crystal clear.",Cancer
"Dec 27, 2022 - You can start your day without all the usual planning. Be free to discover your day as it unfolds. This might feel like it's against your nature, but it's good for you to enjoy life's sometimes arbitrary nature every once in a while. Otherwise, you may miss out on some of the best things life has to offer!",Cancer
"Dec 28, 2022 - As a Cancer, you don't really like to talk about things. Talking just isn't one of your specialties. Everyone has his/her own role, and yours is to take action and create, not talk about doing it. However, the planetary positions today might make you utter a few very deep words. Come on! Tell us a little something about how you feel deep inside!",Cancer
"Dec 29, 2022 - You may tend to be overprotective of the people closest to you, especially children. You may feel you live in a dangerous world in which people don't care about responsibility to one another. But the people you're trying to protect are probably better prepared and adapted to the world than you think, Cancer. They might try to tell you this even if your support is indispensable.",Cancer
"Dec 30, 2022 - Create your own reality, Cancer. It could be that you have the puppet strings in your hands, but you're too afraid to use them. Don't shy away from responsibility. Take your time and don't lose sight of your goals. The stakes are extra high today, and you will find that the slightest movement is magnified several times over. Be careful how you use your words. They won't be taken lightly.",Cancer
"Dec 31, 2022 - This is going to be a great day for you, Cancer. Strangely enough, you will find that tension may help you get things done. There's an easiness today that will create openings for exploring creative outlets. Regarding love and romance, try to stay grounded. You and the object of your desire may have two different points of view on the relationship. Communicate clearly.",Cancer
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo

This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2022 - If you're lacking a regular exercise routine, Leo, today's a great day to turn that around. Exercise doesn't have to wear you out or hurt. Even relaxing activities like walking or yoga are excellent ways to keep you in good shape. Participating in a sport that appeals to you like volleyball or bowling combines fun with exercise. Heck, even dancing is a recognized form of exercise! See about finding something that will work for you.",Leo
"Feb 5, 2022 - Consider channeling your philosophical inspirations into some creative writing, Leo. You’ll certainly enjoy this type of activity. Even if you haven't explored this before, there's no better day than today to give it a whirl. Why not start a journal if you haven't done so already? This will give your ideas a place to incubate, and it can become a starting point for further reflection. Or you could try your hand at poetry and fiction instead.",Leo
"Feb 6, 2022 - It's a good day for you to put some of those creative ideas to work, Leo. Pull out your favorite craft supplies and have some fun exploring color and design. If you have children, consider including them in the activities. It may amaze you to listen to the incredible ideas and innovative thoughts your own kids have that you’ve never thought of. If you don't have an ""idea box"" where old bottles, nuts and bolts, odd buttons, ribbons, and scraps of material can collect for times like this, start one today!",Leo
"Feb 7, 2022 - Your usual outgoing and often radical nature may be far more conservative today, Leo. This can be a result of the day's planetary influences, and if used well, this mood can prove most beneficial. It can add seriousness to your day that suits such activities as goal setting, budget planning, or recovery. Make the most of this energy by digging into the areas of your life that could use some rethinking.",Leo
"Feb 8, 2022 - Practicality and planning will work well for you today, Leo. It's a good time to take a long look at your financial situation. Are you where you want to be? Have you got plans in place for down the road? Do you have sufficient cash flow? Think about what you'd like to improve and make some plans. You can include talking with a financial planner or trusted banker to create more options for yourself.",Leo
"Feb 9, 2022 - The opportunity to attend one or more huge social gatherings, such as balls or banquets, might come your way today, Leo. You might want to attend in the company of a small group of friends. This could be business related or involve a group with which you're affiliated. Nonetheless, it shows the promise of developing into an enlightening experience in one way or another. Accept the invitation and start making your plans!",Leo
"Feb 10, 2022 - Upheavals within a group with which you're affiliated, perhaps professionally, might cause you to alter your goals slightly, Leo. In the long run, this could well prove to be a positive development, although the conditions leading to it could be a bit disconcerting. Think of this as an opportunity to pursue new hopes and dreams that you may not have considered before. Plan carefully and then go for the gold.",Leo
"Feb 11, 2022 - Today you might consider making an investment of time, energy, and perhaps a little money in a creative project of some kind, Leo. This could also involve modern technology in some way. You could have several colleagues who want to work with you on this, and therefore the entire enterprise could be very exciting. Be sure not to lose sight of the practical details involved or you might never get it off the ground.",Leo
"Feb 12, 2022 - A little foreign culture could be the thing you need right now to spice things up a bit, Leo. It could be that you aren't feeling a very strong connection with the environment around you. You could be anxious to spread your wings and explore your freedom. Start small but think big. Get out of your rut and do more exploring on your own. There’s a sobering, disciplined feeling to the day that could help you think realistically about your situation and where you want to go with it.",Leo
"Feb 13, 2022 - This might be a good day to take some time for yourself, Leo. Contact with others, no matter how much you love them, isn't likely to go well, as most people are probably restless and in uncertain moods. This is a good day to catch up on your reading or web surfing and work on projects of your own that you may have been neglecting for a while. You can always contact your friends tomorrow!",Leo
"Feb 14, 2022 - New enterprises that you've worked to perfect for a long time, perhaps involving writing, speaking, or publishing, might pay off today, Leo. Success definitely appears to be in the wind, and those in authority could be more than impressed with what you've been trying to achieve. Grab the gold ring now and take advantage of this opportunity, since it might be a long time before another one comes around. Onward and upward!",Leo
"Feb 15, 2022 - Visitors in your home, perhaps invited by others in your household, could put a crimp in your desire to be alone and hash out your thoughts today, Leo. Your mind is sharp and ideas should come thick and fast. Don't get so irritated with the situation at home that you sabotage your plans. You might want to go off somewhere by yourself, possibly to simply sequester yourself in your own room.",Leo
"Feb 16, 2022 - Don't expect any creative projects to go smoothly today, Leo. You could experience mental blocks that you find difficult to get beyond. Don't let it get to you. The blocks will pass. Just put the project aside and get back to it later. A phone call from a friend might bring some disconcerting news that could cause you to want to pass it on to others. Before you do, make sure you have the facts straight.",Leo
"Feb 17, 2022 - Group activities involving meditation, psychic or spiritual topics, or artistic pursuits are probably very appealing to you right now, Leo. This is the perfect day to start a class or attend a lecture on such subjects. You could meet some interesting people who become close friends. You’re likely to feel a psychic bond with anyone you meet today, and you're likely to get the feeling that your life has changed for the better. Enjoy!",Leo
"Feb 18, 2022 - The workplace could be very hectic today as a colleague prepares to leave on an important business trip, Leo. Nerves could be strained and tempers short. Try to stay focused and get everything necessary done without making yourself crazy. You may be the one who keeps everyone else from going crazy, although you might consider hiding in the closet yourself. Say a prayer of thanks when your colleague finally rides off in the taxi.",Leo
"Feb 19, 2022 - Friction or other trouble on the job could cause you to want to quit, Leo, but worries about money might keep you from doing it. You definitely need to reassess your situation. Perhaps a change of position is just what you need now. You may have untapped talents that could make you more marketable, and you might also want to train those talents. Think about this! And if you really think you want a change, go for it.",Leo
"Feb 20, 2022 - Your home could be a gloomy place today, Leo. A member of the household is likely to be away, and this person's presence is apt to be very sorely missed. The only thing you can do under the circumstances is make sure everyone keeps busy until the absent one returns. One way to distract the family is to get them to clean up the house in anticipation of a warm welcome!",Leo
"Feb 21, 2022 - Today is the final push to complete a very big project you've likely been working on for some time now, Leo. Even though your name won’t be on the cover of the book or business proposal, you’re gratified to have played such a significant role in its completion. Be sure to have a nutritious breakfast and lunch today, because you’re likely to work right through dinner.",Leo
"Feb 22, 2022 - Keep your eyes wide open today, Leo, as you may meet the person of your dreams! Or you could stumble, literally, upon a stack of cash. It’s likely to be a most unusual day, so keep your wits about you and your mind open to all possibilities. If an intriguing new business opportunity comes your way, don't accept it right immediately. Take down all the information and review it when life has settled down somewhat.",Leo
"Feb 23, 2022 - Today you just might want to cut yourself off from the world and hide, Leo. Your backyard or bedroom seems especially attractive right now, and you might have just purchased a new paperback that you're dying to read. You won't even feel like sharing a meal with the rest of the household. Don't worry about this. We all want some time alone occasionally. Your family should understand.",Leo
"Feb 24, 2022 - You’ve been working especially hard and you’re beginning to wonder if all your effort has been for naught. A restructuring at work leaves you wondering just exactly where you fit in or if you even fit in at all. You may have a troubling few days, Leo, but will be relieved to learn that the higher-ups have big plans for you in the newly organized, streamlined company.",Leo
"Feb 25, 2022 - It’s likely that you’re feeling ready for a change, Leo. It isn’t that you’re dissatisfied with your job or environment, rather that your mind is hungry for new challenges. You may be able to satisfy this hunger by taking on more responsibility at work or signing up to attend some evening classes after work. Any new and different activity will give your mind the stimulation it craves.",Leo
"Feb 26, 2022 - If a friend or colleague seems to be in trouble, you may not want to interfere for fear of being too intimate. But this isn't a time to hold back, Leo. It's likely that this person really does need your help. Your intervention will be much appreciated and possibly even rewarded. Be sure to get some rest tonight. You're emotionally and physically drained.",Leo
"Feb 27, 2022 - Today, Leo, you might attend a group event of some kind. While there, you could encounter an old friend who seems to have changed. As a result, you might find this person very attractive and direct a rush of physical passion their way. This could be disconcerting, but don't brush it off because you've always thought of this person as a friend. The most successful marriages are the ones that start out as friendships.",Leo
"Feb 28, 2022 - Today you could receive word of a promotion or exciting new challenge at work. Although this is something you've wanted for a long time, you may hesitate to accept immediately. Could it be because your self-confidence is rather low right now, Leo? Don't let that stop you! This feeling is only temporary, while the opportunity could develop into something lasting. Don't lose your chance!",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Mar 1, 2022 - Boredom and restlessness may plague you today, Leo. You could feel the need to break loose from the ties that bind you to mundane affairs, to run away and seek adventure, although you aren't certain what kind of adventure! The walls may be closing around you at home and on the job. You might want to plan some kind of outing for an upcoming weekend in order to give yourself a needed break.",Leo
"Mar 2, 2022 - Today is an active day for you in which you would do well working with groups of others, Leo. Your imagination is especially active and you might find yourself playing out scenes from your dreams. The people in your life are playing a more important role than they have in times past. Recognize and appreciate these key people. Work with them to lift the layer of fog that seems to be clouding the air today.",Leo
"Mar 3, 2022 - Today you might feel stifled by your current situation. Perhaps you're thinking of changing jobs or professions, or maybe you're considering moving to a more exotic place. These all might be good ideas, Leo, but today isn't the day to make any definite decisions or even consider your options. You aren't in an objective frame of mind. Wait a few days and then think about this some more. You might change your mind.",Leo
"Mar 4, 2022 - Paperwork regarding financial matters may need to be executed at some point today, Leo. You're in the mood for some adventure, perhaps physical or romantic. You might be tempted to participate in challenging sports, such as river rafting or downhill skiing, or you might decide to attend a group meeting and see what opportunities for contacts - not to mention romantic partners! - come your way. Take care! Have fun, but move ahead with caution.",Leo
"Mar 5, 2022 - Put your wisdom into action, Leo. There is no good in accumulating knowledge and then letting it sit, collecting dust like an old book on a shelf. Put your thoughts into motion and watch as magical things begin to manifest before your eyes. You have incredible opportunities today that only come when you're expressing yourself in your truest form. Wear something outlandish to remind yourself and others what an outrageous person you are.",Leo
"Mar 6, 2022 - Be careful of advertising yourself as someone who is so strong and mentally competent that you're capable of handling everything, Leo. Take note that the strongest mule on the trail usually ends up carrying the most weight. Your emotions are more sensitive than you may think, and certainly more than you demonstrate to others. Be honest about the way you feel and not just the way you think.",Leo
"Mar 7, 2022 - You're likely to be on a roll with new and innovative ideas about your goals in life, Leo. Unfortunately, there are some obstacles. People who are scared of the new and different are apt to try to toss a monkey wrench into the spokes of your wheels. More than likely, these people are simply reacting out of fear of something they don't understand. Help them see your perspective.",Leo
"Mar 8, 2022 - As someone who tends to operate through your intellect, Leo, you might be surprised by the surge of romantic passion that comes your way at this time. For today at least, your values might shift from the intellectual to the physical. You'll probably want to plan a romantic evening with someone special. You might even want to get out and spend some money on clothes. Enjoy your day.",Leo
"Mar 9, 2022 - Action is the key word for you today, Leo, so put on some comfortable shoes and have a good time. Infuse a bit of non sequitur playfulness in your dealings with others. Find ways to escape reality for a little while. Take the original scenario and add a twist of the bizarre. Opinions will be especially strong today and conflict may arise, but realize that playfulness and lightheartedness will help any situation.",Leo
"Mar 10, 2022 - A large force is gathering now to make a bold statement and important pledge, Leo. This kind of movement brings together generations and unites people in a revolution. Put away the petty issues and think globally. Educate yourself about what's going on in the world and take a more aggressive stand to fight for what you believe. A small group of intelligent individuals can make a tremendous impact.",Leo
"Mar 11, 2022 - Why keep fighting a fight that you know you can't win, Leo? Why keep trying to fool yourself and others into thinking that you have all the answers when you're only aware of the tip of the iceberg? The mass of knowledge lies well beneath the surface. Instead of fighting, offer to surrender. At this point, others will be much more willing to quench your thirst for truth. The key for you is to listen.",Leo
"Mar 12, 2022 - Other people are the most important aspect of your day today, Leo. You'll find that things might get a bit difficult and unruly alone, but if you connect with others, even the most challenging task becomes almost effortless. One toothpick is easily broken, but 50 toothpicks together are as strong as steel. Conjure up this power created by a force of people who all share a common goal.",Leo
"Mar 13, 2022 - A group you're associated with could bring information to your attention that puts you in a very positive frame of mind and almost has you skipping all the way home. You should enjoy socializing today, Leo, as you're even more gregarious than usual. Both old and new friends could seek out your company. A victory of some kind has come your way, contributing to your great mood. Enjoy your day!",Leo
"Mar 14, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you don't spend too much time at home today. All signs indicate that you're more likely to be out and about, shopping, visiting, and maybe attending a special dinner or concert. There are a number of family activities that you won't want to miss, Leo, so don't let your friends distract you with too much shopping or sports on TV.",Leo
"Mar 15, 2022 - Body and soul might seem out of balance today. A part of you may long to break from society and live a more spiritual life, but worldly responsibilities and an attachment to your current lifestyle could get in your way. These things don't happen overnight, Leo. You have to let them develop in their own way, in their own time. Right now, find balance between the spiritual and the material.",Leo
"Mar 16, 2022 - You should be feeling emotionally strong today, Leo, although you could find that an idea runs through your head that asks you to slow down and take things once step at a time. The internal dialogue could drive you crazy if you aren't careful. The most important thing to do now is simply follow your heart. Do what you love to do, and associate with the people you love and respect the most.",Leo
"Mar 17, 2022 - Practical abilities that you didn't know you possessed might suddenly appear today, Leo. You could be working behind the scenes on a project of some kind, perhaps involving earning some extra money or raising funds for a worthy cause. Your intuition is operating at a high level, so don't be surprised if you tune in to the thoughts of others. Your imagination and inspiration are also on target. Make use of them!",Leo
"Mar 18, 2022 - Feel free to match your plaid pants with your paisley shirt today, Leo. Accessorize with wild sneakers and a striped jacket. Let the oddball within you shine brightly! This is a terrific day for you, and you should feel free to express yourself openly and loudly to the world. You should experience a great deal of self-confidence. Take full advantage of it at this time.",Leo
"Mar 19, 2022 - Today you could make the acquaintance of actors, musicians, or other performers, some of whom might be quite well known. Social occasions could bring valuable contacts your way, which you could make good use of later. You might be having so much fun out among the beautiful people that you really don't want to go home! Don't make it too late a night, however, Leo. You'll need all your energy tomorrow!",Leo
"Mar 20, 2022 - You, along with a significant other in your life, could be very busy trying to make time to see each other today, Leo. Later, when you're finally alone, your phone could be ringing nonstop, further intruding upon your time together. Don't be afraid to turn it off! If a call is particularly important, they'll call again later.",Leo
"Mar 21, 2022 - Good news! It looks as if money is coming your way. Perhaps you're getting a good bonus, or perhaps you've received a good review and will be getting a substantial raise. Hearing about this will definitely boost your mood, Leo, and because you're feeling good, you'll be especially nice to those around you. They'll reciprocate in kind. Enjoy your day!",Leo
"Mar 22, 2022 - New discoveries that capture your imagination could find you spending most of your day sequestered in your home and learning as much as you can. All indications are that you aren't going to want to do much else, Leo, but it's important to remember to take breaks and get a little exercise throughout the day. Moving the body and shaking out the kinks in your muscles can get your mind going as well.",Leo
"Mar 23, 2022 - A group activity could lead to discussions of famous unsolved mysteries, Leo. Jack the Ripper, the Black Dahlia, the truth about O.J. Simpson, and other intriguing problems might capture the interest of everyone present, and might lead to some animated debates over possible solutions. You might want to make mental notes of the ideas everyone comes up with. Each possible solution could tell you a lot about the person proposing it!",Leo
"Mar 24, 2022 - Career matters may be put on hold today, as important communications you're expecting fail to come on time, Leo. As you're anxious to conclude the matters involved, you could make yourself crazy with frustration. Don't do this. Find something else to do while you're waiting and the time will pass more quickly. You'll get something done besides. Your primary concern will be resolved, just not when you'd hoped. Be patient!",Leo
"Mar 25, 2022 - Assessment of others' ideas may be a main focus today, Leo. Group activities could require your intellectual input. A friend could come to you with an idea for a project of some kind. Writing or speaking may be involved in some way. Your friend isn't in a very practical frame of mind, so don't be surprised if the ideas don't seem very workable right now. Don't be discouraging, however. Your friend may surprise you!",Leo
"Mar 26, 2022 - Today you could realize that a friend is actually your soul mate, Leo. You've been spending a lot of time together attending social events, and you've come to realize how much you look forward to each other's company. Your new level of affection seems obvious, but it would be a good idea to put it into words. If you can't screw up the courage to do so, express your thoughts with a gift.",Leo
"Mar 27, 2022 - Have love matters been causing you excessive strain for a while, Leo? If so, you can expect that to end now. Someone you love deeply reciprocates your feelings, and is very anxious to resolve any differences between you and look toward the future. This relationship will probably succeed if you go in with eyes wide open. Don't have unrealistic expectations of your partner. Learn to love human flaws as much as perfection.",Leo
"Mar 28, 2022 - Your visionary tendencies are in the ascendant today, Leo, although they take more of a practical than mystical bent. You might look at your living room or backyard and suddenly find yourself redecorating it in your mind's eye. If you've wanted to start some sort of long-term project to improve your surroundings, this is the day to get started. You'll not only attain your vision, you may surpass it. Have fun!",Leo
"Mar 29, 2022 - If you're artistic by nature, Leo, expect a rush of inspiration to hit today, along with an irresistible compulsion to start a new project and work until you can see at least some results. If you've never been artistic before, you may suddenly feel like giving it a try, perhaps using computer technology. No matter what, you're likely to derive a lot of pleasure from it, so go to it. Have fun!",Leo
"Mar 30, 2022 - An emotional phone call could come from a close friend or love partner, Leo. This person has a lot of worries, and is apt to lay them all on you if you let it happen. You won't want to drop everything that you'd planned to work on today. Tell your friend that you should get together for dinner or coffee and you'll talk about it, and then finish your tasks as quickly as possible.",Leo
"Mar 31, 2022 - If you've been thinking about starting a new creative project, Leo, don't try to do it today. Friends and family could vie for your attention and distract you. Other responsibilities could interfere with your desire to get going on it now. Don't hesitate to try to come up with ideas, but you might have to wait until tomorrow to start the work. Tomorrow you should be raring to go. Be patient!",Leo
"Apr 1, 2022 - It's generally quite clear that you aren't afraid to tell people what you think, Leo. Maybe it's time to be more expressive about how you feel. It could be that your mental process is a bit off today, jolted by an unexpected situation or person. Make sure you incorporate some of your instincts and emotions into your reaction to the situation. Don't rely on your brain alone to have all the answers.",Leo
"Apr 2, 2022 - You might be hard and cold when it comes to the facts, Leo, and you could come across as tough and rather harsh. In reality, this often just masks your sensitive interior. Perhaps you're insecure about your feelings and how you express yourself. People might never know this because you're so good at showing only the strong-willed, electric side of your personality. Be careful of being too stingy about sharing yourself with others.",Leo
"Apr 3, 2022 - Your imagination is your best friend, Leo. You aren't about to let anyone disturb your fantasy world. You have fit love and romance perfectly into this place, and everything is wonderful in your head. Implementing this plan and making it work in the real world are two different things, so try not to get too tied to this idea. Definitely aim to manifest your vision, but don't be unrealistic about it.",Leo
"Apr 4, 2022 - You think of yourself as fairly modern in your thinking, don't you, Leo? But have you really been able to reject tradition entirely? Have you rid yourself of all the outmoded conventions that confined earlier generations? If not, today you'll be inspired to revamp your role models and lighten your workload. Equality in the home is just as important as equality in the workplace.",Leo
"Apr 5, 2022 - The mood you're in today is the stuff of which memorable encounters are made. You'll be wary at first, perhaps even somewhat hostile, to anyone who dares intrude on your freedom. Then suddenly you'll realize that this person is someone special, intriguing, and definitely out of the ordinary. Finally, Leo, you'll realize that the qualities he or she offers just happen to be those you need the most right now.",Leo
"Apr 6, 2022 - A colleague or possibly a romantic partner could be in a rather touchy mood today, Leo. Therefore, you might find this person difficult to deal with. You could get a bit irritated and wonder if this person is worth the aggravation he or she is causing you. Don't do anything foolish. This mood will pass. Try to stay out of your friend's way, if possible. All should be back to normal by tomorrow.",Leo
"Apr 7, 2022 - Today you might attend a party or group activity that puts you in touch with some interesting people from faraway places, Leo. You could find their conversation intellectually stimulating. You're apt to learn a lot from them. Books could be involved in some way. You'll want to stay in touch with them, so be sure to get names, phone numbers or email addresses. This could open up some new doors for you.",Leo
"Apr 8, 2022 - Daydreams full of adventure, perhaps involving travel, could take up a lot of your time today, Leo. You're probably bored with your situation and longing to do something to break your routine. You might have no idea how you can escape from everything right now. Don't force it. Spend the afternoon in a place you don't usually visit. You'll come up with a workable idea in due time. Go for it!",Leo
"Apr 9, 2022 - This isn't a good day to visit the racetrack, Las Vegas, or any store that sells lottery tickets. Stay away from the stock market, too, Leo. Speculation of any kind now could be risky at best and disastrous at worst. Romance is also likely to be blocked today, since you're probably feeling a bit lethargic and not very sociable. Read a good book. That's the most productive thing you could do today!",Leo
"Apr 10, 2022 - You could be surrounded by secrets, Leo. A number of colleagues might be leaving to pursue new opportunities, and you could wonder if there's a reason for it that escapes you. It might even have you reevaluating whether or not you should stay put! However, don't panic because others leave. If there are things about your job that bother you, by all means consider your options.",Leo
"Apr 11, 2022 - Spiritual and psychic matters come to the forefront today, Leo. You could be greatly inspired to express yourself creatively. You could also be quite surprised at the wisdom you find within yourself. A gathering of friends, perhaps for the purpose of discussing metaphysical subjects, could bring this to your attention so blatantly that it becomes hard to ignore. Don't cling to the shore. Flow with the current.",Leo
"Apr 12, 2022 - You're especially intuitive today, Leo. If this is a fairly new occurrence for you, you could be at a loss as to how to make the most of this gift. Only you can know for sure, but one suggestion is to reflect on changes that you'd like to make at work. Pitch them to your boss. With today's keen insight, you'll almost be able to read his or her mind and anticipate any objections.",Leo
"Apr 13, 2022 - Today you could find yourself brainstorming a way to put your inventiveness and ingenuity to work so that you can advance your career by leaps and bounds and increase your income. You could also become involved in artistic projects of some kind. Don't be surprised if great ideas come to you with little effort. You're very intuitive today, Leo, so enjoy it.",Leo
"Apr 14, 2022 - You can expect your life to change in a fairly dramatic way today, Leo. The change could be subtle at first, but with time and distance you're likely to look back on this day as pivotal. You could receive an intriguing piece of news that sets your head spinning with ideas. Perhaps you've been thinking of starting your own business, and today you have an idea. Maybe you meet someone who helps your career. Keep your mind open to the possibilities.",Leo
"Apr 15, 2022 - This will be an exciting day for you intellectually, Leo. A number of intriguing concepts will catch your fancy, and you'll be hungry to learn more about them right away. Your research could take you to a library or onto the Internet. The topics might relate to social or political issues. As irresistible as these new ideas are, don't forget to tend to the business of everyday life.",Leo
"Apr 16, 2022 - You're bound to be busy but happy today, Leo. You'll likely spend the morning doing chores and generally puttering around the house. Don't be surprised if a friend drops by unexpectedly in the afternoon with some important news to share. Your evening could be occupied doing research at the library or on the computer. It seems your friend's news piqued your curiosity about a particular subject.",Leo
"Apr 17, 2022 - Today your strong sense of nostalgia likely has you leaning toward all things old. If you do some furniture shopping, you'll be drawn to antique shops rather than contemporary stores. There is something about the patina that only comes with age. This applies to people as well as objects, which may explain why you tend to prefer to be with people who are older than you.",Leo
"Apr 18, 2022 - Today might be largely devoted to household tasks, Leo. It isn't exactly the most glamorous assignment, but you take a certain pleasure in attending to daily necessities. Pay some bills, throw in a few loads of laundry, do some yard work and cooking. Your partner or family will appreciate your efforts. It's even more fun if it isn't expected of you. And who knows? Maybe they'll reciprocate.",Leo
"Apr 19, 2022 - Get out in the fresh air today in whatever way suits your fancy, Leo. It's important to exercise your body with some brisk physical activity, or at least refresh your spirit with a ride in a convertible. This is a terrific time for you. You feel alive and joyous about your life. Join with others to recognize all that you have, and give thanks for your meal tonight.",Leo
"Apr 20, 2022 - Are you unhappy or uncertain about your current profession, Leo? Are you thinking of making a change? News could reach you today of possible avenues to explore, but you shouldn't make any decision today. Your mind isn't as objective as it should be to think through everything. Think about it, by all means, but wait a day or two before giving serious consideration to anything vital.",Leo
"Apr 21, 2022 - Love and romance take top priority with you today, Leo. You might be feeling a little insecure about the stability of your current relationship, but you're wasting your energy. For now, at least, things look very promising for you and your current lover. You should be communicating well and getting along great. Use your intuition to tune in to your friend's mind, and you'll probably feel your doubts and uncertainties slip away. Enjoy your day.",Leo
"Apr 22, 2022 - Have you been waiting to hear about some funds, Leo, perhaps to create a piece of art, write a book, or make a documentary film? If so, you could have a lot to celebrate today when you receive news that the money is forthcoming! Don't be surprised if there's a delay, however. The project is still going to happen, but just a little later than you'd hoped. All you can do now is be patient.",Leo
"Apr 23, 2022 - You feel that life would run more smoothly if money didn't exist! The amount of time and energy you spend sorting out your financial affairs is frustrating. Unfortunately, Leo, today will be a frustrating day. Today you need to sit down and sort out some neglected bills. It isn't fun, but at least by the end of the day you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you got it done.",Leo
"Apr 24, 2022 - Just how long has it been since you indulged in a big helping of your favorite guilty pleasure, Leo? It's time to let the youngster in you come out and play today. Eat that chocolate, read those mindless magazines, or skip down the sidewalk. You've been taking life much too seriously lately. Even grownups are entitled to indulge in the pleasures of youth from time to time.",Leo
"Apr 25, 2022 - If you come across someone a little strange or eccentric today, try and get to know him or her, because that person could be a reflection of part of you. The person will help you to see how modern and innovative you are, and how much you should appreciate your wonderful qualities. Meeting this person could be a kind of exercise in self-satisfaction.",Leo
"Apr 26, 2022 - You're likely to feel optimistic and enthusiastic about life today, Leo. You might also feel especially sexy, a feeling you should definitely take advantage of! Why not plan a romantic evening with your loved one? Don't hesitate to talk about your travel dreams over dinner. You never know, he or she just might share your dream. Before you know it, the two of you could be winging your way to exotic lands.",Leo
"Apr 27, 2022 - A colleague's motives could seem rather sinister today, Leo. This person has a definite agenda of his or her own that may not take into account the needs or feelings of anyone who could conceivably stand in the way. This person isn't to be trusted. Don't excuse his or her behavior. The best course of action now is to stay out of the way and protect yourself on all levels.",Leo
"Apr 28, 2022 - Your curiosity and creative energy may be stimulated today by information you receive from books, documentaries, or conversations with people familiar with the field you're exploring. As a result, Leo, you could come up with an innovative new project that keeps you and some colleagues busy for a long time. But don't worry - this enterprise should be full of surprises and therefore anything but tedious. Go to it!",Leo
"Apr 29, 2022 - A friend or romantic partner might need your advice, Leo, and want to discuss a few things that you don't really understand. This could concern this person's job, which involves a lot of technicalities with which you're unfamiliar. Don't be afraid to stop occasionally and ask for an explanation. If you're going to be of any help, you have to have some idea of what this person is talking about.",Leo
"Apr 30, 2022 - If you happen to be training for a new trade, learning a new technique, or perhaps you're being evaluated after an internship period, you can expect these pursuits to conclude on a high note. You may have been somewhat afraid that those in authority would frown upon your originality, Leo. On the contrary, it seems the people in charge appreciate it more than you know.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"May 1, 2022 - You should use the day to ponder your professional future, Leo. Many forces seem to be working together to clarify your ideas on the subject. Rather than rebelling at the slightest provocation, as you've been doing lately, it would be much more reasonable for you to think first about the basic material needs of you and your family.",Leo
"May 2, 2022 - You might feel as if your powerful emotions are getting in the way of your dreams, Leo. Or perhaps you're finding that you're so wrapped up in a particular vision of the future that you're getting lost in your own brain. You're losing touch with the present simply because you're so focused on a nebulous idea that doesn't even exist yet. Take a step back from your current mindset and reevaluate the situation.",Leo
"May 3, 2022 - You are an excellent friend, and you take pride in helping the people around you. Have you ever thought about getting involved in a humanitarian cause or giving a few hours of your time every week to your local community? Today, Leo, these kinds of ideas could become a real part of your life. It's time to use all of your great ideas to help others.",Leo
"May 4, 2022 - A gloomy guest could arrive today, Leo, and likely need some cheering up. Do the best you can, but don't try to do it by cooking a meal. The results of your efforts might not be all that exciting. This is a great day to go for fast food. Take your friend to a movie, concert, or art gallery. This could get your mind off his or her troubles and your mind off your friend!",Leo
"May 5, 2022 - A talent for interior decoration that you may or may not have been aware of could inspire you to do some work on your home. You'll probably consider a lot of different options and make long lists of possibilities, Leo. Discussions with friends and family members can bring new ideas to mind. You might want to take a chance and try something a little different. Go to it and have fun.",Leo
"May 6, 2022 - Your upbeat, lively nature is fueled by the fast-paced energy at hand. You have a great deal of physical strength available to you, Leo, and you can make tremendous strides in your yearly goals with very minimal effort. Take advantage of this time by focusing on your own needs. There is a great deal of support in place that will help you accomplish whatever your goals may be. Go for it.",Leo
"May 7, 2022 - The notion of truth could get shot down today due to someone who knows you better than most, Leo. It won't take a long, drawn-out conversation or deep explanation to reveal the fact that there is a bit of deception that has been covering the truth. Don't try to hide from loved ones who are only trying to do what's best for you. Be open and honest with those who really care.",Leo
"May 8, 2022 - You might be tempted to settle certain matters by radical means. The visionary part of you means you're painfully aware of the world's wrongs. You see no reason not to take action to correct them. But the forces in play are so powerful that you can't expect to institute a new order in one day. If you have an emotional question to resolve, it would be better to wait a few days before making a decision.",Leo
"May 9, 2022 - Who would have guessed that you have an ability to understand subjects as irrational as human passions? You're getting down and dirty with the sticky, trivial realities of day-to-day life that never interested you before. Your new nonstick coating would make you an excellent personnel director, hiring and firing at the drop of a hat. Has that thought ever occurred to you?",Leo
"May 10, 2022 - Today's aspects will clarify any team situations of which you're a part, Leo. This could concern teams in your private or professional life. This is the moment to take action. Make use of any benefits gleaned from your reflections of the past few days. Don't be afraid to modify what is already in place. If you hesitate, you will only succeed in making yourself more anxious.",Leo
"May 11, 2022 - Today is going to be an excellent day for meeting interesting people, Leo. And there will be nothing superficial about these encounters. On the contrary, the people you are going to meet will touch you profoundly and move you deeply on an emotional level. But don't let yourself be seduced by ideas alone! Practicality matters, too!",Leo
"May 12, 2022 - Your creative talents should be operating at an all-time high today, Leo. You might be offered an opportunity to earn some money putting them to use. Your excitement and enthusiasm are likely to ensure that you'll do the best you possibly can and earn a lot of approval from those around you. Your intuition is also operating at a high level, boosting your imagination and relations with others. Enjoy your day!",Leo
"May 13, 2022 - Intimacy will be in the air over the next few days. Loved ones suddenly want to spend more time with you, and you'll want to invite friends over every night! By all means, do. You'll be recharged, and some of the wonderful discussions could lead to something great. However, there may be a bit of tension in the air to temper all that closeness, since not everyone will agree with your point of view.",Leo
"May 14, 2022 - You may feel hemmed in by the role models that society currently offers, Leo. As you struggle to find your own definition of the truly modern human being, the people around you sometimes criticize your liberated attitude. Just because their ideas aren't in sync with yours in no way invalidates them. If your ideas are a tad too radical, theirs are too conventional. There's room for both points of view.",Leo
"May 15, 2022 - The mood you're in today is the stuff of which memorable encounters are made, Leo. You'll be wary at first, perhaps even somewhat hostile to someone who dares to intrude on your freedom. Then suddenly you'll realize that this person is someone special, intriguing, and definitely out of the ordinary. Finally, you'll see that the qualities they offer just happen to be what you need most right now.",Leo
"May 16, 2022 - You may need to take a more disciplined approach to your communication today, Leo. Try not to be so harsh and limiting with your words. People respond better to comforting expressions and a sympathetic tone. Cold, abrasive facts will only aggravate an existing wound. Tone things down. Allot yourself some quiet time to be alone and contemplate your state of mind.",Leo
"May 17, 2022 - Overall, the climate is tense at work and at home, Leo. You'll sense a feeling of restlessness and a longing for change, but you'll also feel a reluctance to make any real moves in that direction. Your judgment tells you that complaints that don't lead to action are meaningless. So why not be the catalyst that provokes some action?",Leo
"May 18, 2022 - Sometimes you feel like you're navigating through a thick fog, but the obscurity will finally lift today. The skies ahead are sunny and clear! You can expect an invitation to take a little trip or an offer to belong to a special group. Don't pass up any opportunities to have fun, Leo. You can benefit from a diversion right now!",Leo
"May 19, 2022 - You will find that disciplined actions are the best way to go about your day today, Leo. Stay focused on your path. You can accomplish many tasks at the same time if you play your cards right. Try not to get bogged down with details. People might cause you to worry too much. Don't let their energy get in the way of your progress.",Leo
"May 20, 2022 - Your strong opinions might come into conflict with strong emotions today, Leo. Be aware that fountains of intensity are likely to spring from you as if you were a bottomless well. Realize that you might need pay less attention to your logic today and concentrate on your heart. It could be hard to reason with people. If your heart doesn't support what you say, you might as well not say it.",Leo
"May 21, 2022 - Today's prospects should suit the dynamic, idealistic being that you are, especially right now. There will be some criticism in the air, and you won't miss an opportunity to punctuate your comments with your famous irony. Your viewpoints on corporate rigidity and conformist attitudes are well known, but today your sense of humor prevails and people listen to you with pleasure!",Leo
"May 22, 2022 - You may have the intellectual side of the equation completely set in your head, Leo. You've collected all the facts and have all the data worked out in such a way that it's impossible for anyone to fault your calculations. Don't think you're done, because there's one part of the picture left to consider - emotions. Extreme feelings could put a monkey wrench in your plans. Be prepared.",Leo
"May 23, 2022 - Tension is apt to build to a high level if you aren't careful about how you use words, Leo. The tricky thing is that forces are going to try to push you and pull you in different ways. You may encourage a focus on the collective, while others worry only about themselves. Still another force calls for outdated remedies and traditional structures that no longer work for you. Blaze your own trail!",Leo
"May 24, 2022 - If you're looking for a new job, Leo, perhaps this is the day you find it. ""Lucky” is the word that sums up today! Without encouraging you to play the lottery, you can be pretty sure that you'll feel a surge of confidence. You'll be able to resolve big or small problems with practicality and ease. That's lucky enough, isn't it?",Leo
"May 25, 2022 - Strong forces may be acting up and asking you to stand up a little straighter than usual, Leo. Keep your shoulders back and be proud. Don't think of yourself as any less of a person just because there is disagreement between you and the people around you. Maintain respect for yourself and your opinions. Say things with confidence. Don't back down, but be prepared to fight.",Leo
"May 26, 2022 - You may have had a hard time launching long-term personal projects lately, Leo. Today marks a critical starting point toward attaining your goals. Perhaps there has been some confusion or delay in this area. You'll find that things are suddenly becoming much clearer. Move forward with projects that you've put off because they were too frustrating to deal with.",Leo
"May 27, 2022 - Don't try to force your ideas on anyone, Leo. It's important to maintain neutrality so you can act from a stable state of mind when someone brings you an issue that needs to be dealt with right away. The key is to act rather than react to a situation. If you know you're right about something, keep it to yourself. There's no need to rub it in anyone's face and tell them they're wrong.",Leo
"May 28, 2022 - It's an excellent forecast for you, Leo! Although no specific events will occur, there is the huge promise of freedom over the next seven months. A fundamental shift is about to occur in your occupation and love life, As the months unfold, you can expect to be more visionary, more creative, and perhaps more rebellious. This time, you'll be much more effective than in the past two or three years.",Leo
"May 29, 2022 - Don't let things bother you, Leo. Have confidence that you're on the right track. Your strong will and erratic habits will prove quite effective on a day like today, when things are floundering and indecision abounds. It's your opportunity to grab the reins where other people have dropped them. If this puts you center stage, you're good with it. You know exactly what to say.",Leo
"May 30, 2022 - It may be hard to find answers today, Leo. It may also be hard for you to get your point across, especially since everyone's head is in the clouds. Don't be surprised if your own head takes a trip up there as well. You're better off giving it a boost up there instead of trying to force yourself back down to reality. Check things out from a different perspective.",Leo
"May 31, 2022 - This is one of those days in which you might not be fully appreciated for the wonderful breath of fresh air you bring to the group, Leo. It may seem that the old and the stale are seeking revenge on anyone attempting change. Don't give in to the negative forces that would keep you from fully expressing yourself. Be confidence that you have what it takes to be successful in whatever path you decide to follow.",Leo
"Jun 1, 2022 - Important enterprises centering on your home could take up a lot of your energy over the next few days, Leo. Many people might come and go from your life. Perhaps you're moving to a nicer place, or maybe transacting a lot of business in your home. Whatever it is, it's likely to produce the results you're hoping for. Work hard and make the most of it.",Leo
"Jun 2, 2022 - You usually tend toward rational and scientific ways of thinking, Leo, but today you might be so intuitive that you're more likely to use your psychic abilities. This can be a mixed blessing. Your rational nature protects you from identifying too much with the world's less fortunate. Today this protection is greatly lessened, so be prepared to emotionally identify with everybody.",Leo
"Jun 3, 2022 - Today you might feel a powerful need to write down your thoughts, Leo, but they could prove a bit too amorphous for you to put into words. You might also have difficulty making contact with friends or loved ones. You may keep missing each other. Getting to where you want to go could prove frustrating. In spite of small irritations, this should be an enjoyable day. Hang in there.",Leo
"Jun 4, 2022 - Oppressive stress on you or those close to you could cause disconcerting upsets within your relationships today, Leo. Try to be objective and work things out rationally instead of going to pieces. Avoid being sucked into quarrels where you might say things you'll regret. Don't let this temporary situation get the best of you. Make the effort to stay focused and relaxed. Tomorrow all should be back to normal.",Leo
"Jun 5, 2022 - The possibility of the arrival of visitors, perhaps in relation to a group activity or social event you hope to host in the future, could put you in cleanup mode and perhaps encourage you to even do a little redecorating. More than one person is likely to try to contact you, Leo, and all who reach you are likely to have interesting news and useful information. By day's end your energy and enthusiasm should be much higher than they were in the morning.",Leo
"Jun 6, 2022 - Communication flows freely today, Leo. Land might be discussed. At some point you'll be reminded of someone from the past and experience a momentary wave of longing to see this person again. This won't last, however. You'll be too busy relating to those you’re currently talking to. Expect to learn a lot and accomplish more throughout the course of the day. Go for the gold.",Leo
"Jun 7, 2022 - A neighbor or relative you haven't spoken to for a while might contact you out of the blue, Leo. Make the time to talk, as it could open up doors for you that you wouldn't normally expect. Relationships of all kinds should be going especially well, and these include romantic ones. If you're involved, expect to grow closer. If you aren't currently involved, don't be surprised if someone new and exciting enters your life.",Leo
"Jun 8, 2022 - Today, Leo, you'll undoubtedly ask yourself a lot of questions. You tend to be rather introverted, and you typically need a great deal of freedom. You're usually an energetic person, but with the current astral energy at play, you may feel lonely and doubtful of your abilities. Take time today to analyze your commitments to others.",Leo
"Jun 9, 2022 - Today you may be wondering just how much you should get involved in a certain conflict between family members or in your career. There's a lot of pressure on you to find an answer to this problem. But all you have to do is not take sides and everything should work out fine. You may finally realize that it's probably best to just let things happen for once.",Leo
"Jun 10, 2022 - You've always felt the need to free yourself from society. You need to feel independent at any cost. You may need to face certain relationship problems at this time. Perhaps you're hesitant to commit either at work or in your personal life. You may ask yourself if your attitude isn't in fact revealing a desire to get away from it all. Perhaps you'll find the answer today.",Leo
"Jun 11, 2022 - Today your emotional intuition intensifies your mental abilities, Leo. Friends and family members are likely to grow closer to you. You may be more aware of what they really need and want, and they could see you in a new light. This can make you feel loved and wanted. The downside is that your empathy is so high that you may pick up on everyone's aches and pains. Try to keep yourself bathed in the white light.",Leo
"Jun 12, 2022 - Home and family are apt to be your primary focus today, Leo. Work around the house might take up a lot of your time. You might want to spruce up the place and make it more beautiful. Gardening could be especially rewarding now. If you've wanted to try some recipes from a new cookbook, this is the day to do it. Your creative impulses regarding food are at an all-time high.",Leo
"Jun 13, 2022 - Your day has finally come, Leo. You have your own vision of life and you like sharing it with others. You're far from thinking that you're any sort of new messiah, but you feel the need to talk to children or young people about your views. Today, you'll be able to communicate clearly with the people around you and they'll be receptive to your ideas.",Leo
"Jun 14, 2022 - Today's celestial configuration will be favorable to changes in your relationships, Leo. Your professional and private lives will be influenced by how well you deal with these relationships. You may have decided that in one way or another your behavior needs to change. Now it's time for you to act. Don't be discouraged if it takes a while to see lasting improvement.",Leo
"Jun 15, 2022 - Today you might decide to do some repairs or decorating in your home. You'll have a lot of good ideas welling up from deep within you, Leo, and be astute enough to put them to work in the real world. You might not feel much like talking, however. Therefore, don't be surprised if communication is more subtle than overt today.",Leo
"Jun 16, 2022 - A lot of serious matters are on your mind, perhaps involving plans for the future. It's likely that you'll want to stay home today and do some contemplating. Various new opportunities could be coming your way, Leo, and you won't want to let them pass you by without serious consideration. Chores around the house could prove a valuable outlet for physical energy while allowing thoughts to churn in your mind.",Leo
"Jun 17, 2022 - A lot of people around you might think that you are a strong individual, Leo. For example, you stand up against wrongs in the established social order. You can also be a very constructive person. You try to improve the world around you. Today, Leo, you'll have all the time you like to meditate about the changes this world needs.",Leo
"Jun 18, 2022 - Scientists are sometimes pretty strange. They can be so engrossed in reality that they seem almost absent from it, as if they float above the Earth. That's a bit how you feel about things, too, Leo. You like to explain the world in your own special way, the way you see it and not necessarily the way it really is. That's your secret. You know that no one else can see the world the way you do.",Leo
"Jun 19, 2022 - You're an eccentric person, Leo. Yet you also feel the need to be loved and feel the approval of those around you. It isn't always easy to think differently from other people or to feel completely different. In order to be accepted, you must help them understand you. Try to express your ideas and opinions in a more realistic way. You can't live out of sync all the time.",Leo
"Jun 20, 2022 - A troubled night with little sleep could have you feeling out of sorts and not like doing much socializing today. If you can, Leo, work on projects at home alone where you can stop and take a nap if you want. Your concentration may not be what it usually is, but if you isolate yourself from distractions, you should be happy with what you accomplish. In the meantime, take care of yourself.",Leo
"Jun 21, 2022 - Arguments that have been brewing are coming to a climactic point for you, Leo. Don't be surprised if heated opposition rears its head today. This is likely a result of your own doing. Cycles of anger are reaching a critical point, and your stubborn character is butting heads with an equally strong force. Try not to take yourself too seriously. Life is meant to be fun. Our objective is to be happy.",Leo
"Jun 22, 2022 - Try not to be too fixed in your attitude today, Leo. Realize that you may have to give a little in order to work comfortably with the people around you. It's important that you be slow and reserved in your moves, especially in matters of the heart. Be open and receptive. Try not to scare anyone away with abrasive words or insisting that you're always right.",Leo
"Jun 23, 2022 - This is a great day for you to get up on stage and make your presence known, Leo. Let people know that you're the leader of the pack. There is a great need for you to take the helm now, and you shouldn't back away from this responsibility. The warrior instinct inside you is probably strong, so don't hesitate for a second. Be brave and courageous in all situations.",Leo
"Jun 24, 2022 - Not only your own success but that of members of your household could have you on a real emotional high today, Leo. Your mind is likely to be buzzing with possibilities for future expansion, some of which may not be all that workable. However, you should allow yourself a few flights of fancy. Tomorrow your feet will be back on the ground and you'll see things in a more practical light.",Leo
"Jun 25, 2022 - Tonight you might host a virtual social event, perhaps for business associates. You could be nervous at first, Leo, wondering if all will go as well as you hope, but your efforts should produce the results you want. You might be introduced to new contacts, leading to increased opportunities. Take a walk after it’s over. Your mind will be churning, and you'll want to clear your head.",Leo
"Jun 26, 2022 - Confusion over money matters might come up for you today, Leo. You may need to check your records in order to shed light on some past transactions. Don't panic. All should be well. You just need to ascertain the facts. You might have some rather intense dreams tonight. Write them down. You'll want to remember them later, as they could reveal a lot about your current situation. They might also inspire future projects.",Leo
"Jun 27, 2022 - Today may be one of those days when you don't know which way to turn, Leo. You're spinning around, and no direction looks good to you. For some reason, your engine won't turn off, and you just keep going in circles. If you can, stop and take a rest. Walk around for a while until your head stops spinning. Wait until the air clears before making your next major move.",Leo
"Jun 28, 2022 - Heightened intuition and ESP could lead to some interesting conversations with others who are blown away by your insights into their thoughts, feelings, and desires. You could also be feeling more expressive than usual, Leo. You might want to channel some of that inspiration into writing, speaking, or some other form of self-expression. Reading may also prove especially valuable at this time.",Leo
"Jun 29, 2022 - Speak your mind today, Leo, but don't take offense if it seems like no one is listening. Don't push your viewpoint. Concentrate on your goals and aspirations, and feel free to push them to the limit. You might have been doing a lot of talking lately. Getting those ideas out there is a great thing. Now is the time when you need to lay some solid groundwork for those ideas to manifest.",Leo
"Jun 30, 2022 - Your newfangled approach to things might get some serious flak from others today, Leo, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature is a key ingredient in keeping the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when old, tired ways of doing things insist on taking the upper hand. Use your power from within to combat the forces from above.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Jul 1, 2022 - You could find that an emotional issue rubs you the wrong way today, Leo. Your tendency is to want to escape. Try to do so in a healthy manner. Watch your favorite movie or read a book. Don't fall prey to the temptation to indulge in more dangerous pursuits. That would only push the problems away temporarily. When they resurface again, they could be even harder to handle.",Leo
"Jul 2, 2022 - Pay attention to the news today, Leo. Be sure to check not just the mainstream news but also the offbeat independent publications and websites. Question what you hear and read. Take an active role in increasing your knowledge of the world. Take responsibility for your citizenship by keeping an eye on what's going on. Information is an important aspect of power.",Leo
"Jul 3, 2022 - This is an excellent day for you, Leo, so live it up! Your ego is strong, and beautiful things are flowing your way in general. You should enjoy a good mood that will attract favorable people and situations. There is virtually no limit to the expansiveness of this day. One thing to watch for, however, is that you don't get too arrogant. Be proud but not obnoxious.",Leo
"Jul 4, 2022 - Stop hiding behind the intellectual barrier that you may have put up, Leo. Playing games will get you nowhere. True strength is being able to demonstrate that you have the courage to say what you feel in any situation, especially regarding a close loved one. If you need to say something, say it. Don't wait until the situation escalates to an unhealthy argument before you finally get your feelings out.",Leo
"Jul 5, 2022 - If people hassle you or give you a hard time about your appearance today, pay them no mind, Leo. You have the right to live your life any way you want to. If that means you want to go around the house in a grubby T-shirt and tattered sweatpants that haven't been washed in months, then so be it. Feel free to be whoever you want to be.",Leo
"Jul 6, 2022 - Get up early and get working, Leo. You have a lot of emotional and physical energy that should help you accomplish whatever you need to do. The planetary energy is on your side. Take advantage of it to say what's on your mind and get closer to wherever you need to be. Your active and receptive sides are in agreement today. You should be able to find a healthy balance between giving and receiving.",Leo
"Jul 7, 2022 - It's important for you to take action on a day like today, Leo. Trust yourself and your instincts. Oftentimes you'll have the perfect advice for every situation and every other person except yourself. Remember that you might have to consult others in order to find the best counsel for yourself. Talk things out and take definitive action. Hesitation causes delay. You have all the facts you need.",Leo
"Jul 8, 2022 - Find comfort in your work today, Leo. Although it may sound ridiculous, you'll find that getting things checked off your list is the most rewarding activity of the day. Try not to be too critical of others. Focus on your own tasks at hand. Mountains that seem too daunting will continue to grow bigger until you take the first step. Your perseverance will be an inspiration to others.",Leo
"Jul 9, 2022 - You might find that others are adopting a bit of a ""me first"" attitude that doesn't quite sit right with you, Leo. You may need to knock on their door, wake them up, and say, ""Hey, what about everybody else?"" Try not to whine as you deliver this message. A desperate-sounding attitude will get you nowhere. Be friendly and jovial in your approach and the world will be at your feet.",Leo
"Jul 10, 2022 - Today your intellect is likely to be more inclined than usual to explore fields that seem a bit speculative. Ancient spiritual rites, prehistory, or strange stories could be on your mind, Leo. You might seek books on these subjects. Usually you tend to be skeptical about such things, but now you want to learn about them. Hang onto your logic and learn what you can! You'll enjoy yourself at the very least!",Leo
"Jul 11, 2022 - You may be seduced by fantastic promises that offer wonderful things and fanciful rewards. But beware of anything with lots of bells and whistles, Leo. There may be a great deal of talk but not much to substantiate such wonderful claims. Don't be surprised if people with intense emotions are stepping up to put in their two cents about how you should run your life. Don't forget who is boss.",Leo
"Jul 12, 2022 - Don't be surprised if unexpected actions from others give your heart a jolt today, Leo. You could find that a strong force of erratic energy affects your emotions. It's working to stir things up quite a bit. Use your beliefs and morals as guideposts to help you navigate difficult waters. Stay true to yourself and don't let others make decisions for you. You have the power to make very significant breakthroughs.",Leo
"Jul 13, 2022 - A group you're involved with may want to discuss a future trip of some kind, Leo, perhaps to a convention. The drive to expand your horizons is very strong today. Therefore, trips like this or other opportunities to learn and grow can be especially appealing. You might come up with a few ideas of your own that you prefer to pursue alone. Give it some thought!",Leo
"Jul 14, 2022 - Today, Leo, you might find yourself thinking longingly of exotic lands and possibly traveling to them in the future. You could also wonder about the people who live in those countries. Romantic daydreams may distract you from your day-to-day business, so it's important to stay focused. Read travel books and rent travel videos. In the meantime, you still have to get through each day.",Leo
"Jul 15, 2022 - You're probably feeling especially sexy, Leo, and you might want to take a lover out for a romantic dinner, if possible. You would especially enjoy going all out, experimenting with a new outfit, scent, or hairstyle. On a more mundane note, investments of either time or money should pay off today, as could hard work performed in the past. Have a great day!",Leo
"Jul 16, 2022 - The day ahead should be excellent. You've been searching for meaning behind recent events. No doubt there have been a lot of changes both at work and at home. You're bursting with new ambition. Today, Leo, you're likely to put all these experiences into the hopper, stir them up, and be grateful for the thrilling life you lead right now! You may not get a specific answer. Sometimes feeling grateful is an answer all its own.",Leo
"Jul 17, 2022 - You tend to be adventurous at the calmest of times, Leo. Today you could be feeling especially daring. You might be tempted to make some radical changes in your life, particularly where your profession is concerned. You could decide to make your living in an offbeat way, or possibly move to a place you've never considered before. Think about it for a few days. The impetus might pass. If it doesn't, then follow your heart.",Leo
"Jul 18, 2022 - Today you're likely to be in just the right place at the right time to meet the right person. You're overdue for a lucky break and probably not expecting it. You may start the day in a restless and frustrated state of mind, Leo, but whatever happens will catapult you out of it. Be prepared - this transition may involve vast changes in your life, in the long run if not immediately.",Leo
"Jul 19, 2022 - When it comes to love and romance, you may find yourself in a bit of a pickle, Leo. There's a request for greater commitment now. You may be unsure about how to respond. You may hesitate to give up the sense of freedom that you hold so dear. Recognize the importance of a close connection with one other person. Give yourself the opportunity to experience this kind of intense relationship on a more permanent basis.",Leo
"Jul 20, 2022 - Your insight, creativity, and inventiveness are in full swing, Leo, and new ideas come thick and fast. However, you might find yourself too caught up in boring, mundane tasks to do very much about it. Yet physical energy is plentiful, so you have it in you to take care of chores and then have time to do what you enjoy. You'll produce results if you remember to pace yourself. Work too hard and you'll be too tired!",Leo
"Jul 21, 2022 - You may be anxious to try an uncharted path that speaks to your sense of risk and adventure, Leo. It's important to temper these actions with realistic planning. You're much more likely to get a flat tire when you don't carry a spare. Make sure you have the proper resources to pull yourself out of any jam along the way. The old way of doing things is practical, tested, and tried and true for a reason, so don't dismiss it altogether.",Leo
"Jul 22, 2022 - You may feel a strong need to express your individuality, Leo. You don't want to blend into the herd, unseen as you walk down the street. You want to be the sheep with the blue wool, the person skipping instead of walking. Find a place or group that lets you be yourself and not worry about what other people think about your style. Your originality is inspiring. Don't squelch it.",Leo
"Jul 23, 2022 - Today is a great day to gather data for a new project you're working on, Leo. Put your nose to the grindstone and make some major progress on an important job. Find comfort in your work. Make sure, however, that the work you're engaged in is something that feeds your soul as opposed to just put money in your pocket. This is critical to maintaining a healthy mind and spirit.",Leo
"Jul 24, 2022 - Someone might feel obligated to give you their two cents even if you didn't ask for it, Leo. Be careful not to dismiss this information without giving it proper consideration. This knowledge comes to you for a reason, and it's possible that it's the very piece of information you need now in order to complete the puzzle. Don't disregard anything, regardless of how esoteric it seems.",Leo
"Jul 25, 2022 - Actively express your thoughts today, Leo. You'll find that a great deal of information needs to be exchanged. You have the power to deliver a strong, thoughtful message to others, so don't give up this opportunity to exercise your acute mind. You may also find people to be rather argumentative, but don't let this keep you from expressing your true thoughts on the matter at hand.",Leo
"Jul 26, 2022 - Get your broom out of the closet today, Leo. Your job is to brush away the cobwebs from the corners of your emotional bedroom. Use the intense transformative energy of the day to say goodbye to stale and unsatisfactory relationships that have left a bad taste in your mouth. Ignite the fire of a new situation and consciously try to establish new habits so that old patterns don't continue to repeat themselves.",Leo
"Jul 27, 2022 - Reap all the riches that a new day has to offer, Leo. Every day brings new opportunities and the chance for rapid advancement. Grab the things offered to you. You have a great deal of potential, but potential is one of those things that does no good until you realize it and harness it. Today is one day in which you can take an important step toward manifesting your dreams.",Leo
"Jul 28, 2022 - Your mental ability could be rather sluggish and lazy today. It could be that you aren't feeling as sharp as you'd like, Leo. This is most likely a sign that you simply need to slow down and relax. Don't feel as if you always need to deliver the keynote address. Be more of an audience member today and take advice from the other people up on stage.",Leo
"Jul 29, 2022 - Remember that the important thing isn't necessarily what you're doing but the people you're with, Leo. There's a great deal of passion in the air today that you can latch onto and put to good use. Have fun and remember to smile. You can make a great deal of progress toward your goals as long as you stay motivated. Connect with others and feel the strength of shared resources.",Leo
"Jul 30, 2022 - This is likely to be an intense day, Leo. Family and friends may seem testy, so you're advised to stay out of their way. Don't worry - it isn't anything you've done. It's the planetary energy. If you can go someplace private and shut the door, do it. If someone tries to pick a fight, don't rise to the bait. Tomorrow the air will clear and good spirits will reign again.",Leo
"Jul 31, 2022 - This is a day of untold opportunity, Leo. If you've been concerned that you haven't been using your full creative potential, you can put that concern to rest today. Your creativity is boundless and you'll finally realize it. Be on the lookout for any unusual opportunities. Someone or something you encounter could have meaningful ripple effects on you.",Leo
"Aug 1, 2022 - An inner voice is warning you to slow down, Leo. It's probably best if you take a break and let someone else take the lead. Concentrate on matters at home and take care of issues that crop up among loved ones. It's quite possible that an argument is brewing. Whether you realize it or not, there are serious issues that need to be addressed.",Leo
"Aug 2, 2022 - Pieces of your life that you've tried to avoid for some time may come to the surface today and cause you a bit of trouble, Leo. That which isn't organized or structured is getting more and more chaotic just to teach you a lesson. Take care of things now. Put things in order and become more aware of the ticking of the clock. There's a reason you need to take care of business.",Leo
"Aug 3, 2022 - There's a flurry of activity around you today that you should latch onto, Leo. You'll be on a magic carpet ride that takes you into the clouds. The most difficult thing to remember is to not get so carried away that you lose sight of the ground. Keep in mind that things aren't always exactly the way they seem. What appears to work perfectly today may not work at all tomorrow.",Leo
"Aug 4, 2022 - Some older people, perhaps your parents, might be too vocal in their assessment of how you're handling a situation, Leo. You're particularly sensitive today, and far less tolerant of criticism than usual. Don't lash out. Causing a rift won't solve anything. Change the subject and take whatever course of action you feel is best.",Leo
"Aug 5, 2022 - There could be some tough forces questioning your most cherished dreams, Leo. Be careful about confronting someone who wants to poke holes in your idealism. You could end up feeling like a punctured balloon that's slowly deflating. Do whatever you can to avoid the aggression at work to bring you down. Don't let others get to you.",Leo
"Aug 6, 2022 - Things seem to be going quite well for you in many respects, Leo. Your thinking is clear, your emotions are under control, and the puzzle pieces are fitting into place. This is your time to take advantage of these pockets of good fortune and turn them into something huge. You have the power to make anything happen - especially now.",Leo
"Aug 7, 2022 - If you're in the arts or sciences, Leo, sudden inspiration could cause you to start or continue a project that means a lot to you. Some friends or group members could help out with useful information. Your mind may generate new ideas throughout the day. Once you've finished your work, take a walk and clear your head. Watch a video. If you don't, it could be hard to sleep tonight.",Leo
"Aug 8, 2022 - If you're able to be involved in a class or any kind of group activity or social situation, be prepared for quarrels to break out among people there, Leo. You could find this counterproductive and useless. You might be tempted to try to break in and put a stop to it. It's best to stay out of it. Work out your frustration by walking home. You'll feel better.",Leo
"Aug 9, 2022 - Circumstances beyond your control might get in the way of attending a group event. This could cause some disappointment for you and others, Leo. It's best to find something else to do. Your own project is likely to need some attention, and this could prove to be a challenge that keeps you engrossed for hours. Treat yourself to takeout tonight.",Leo
"Aug 10, 2022 - Today you may feel the need to do a lot of work around your home, Leo. Perhaps you expect future visitors or simply want to spruce up the place for yourself. You may need to pace yourself and not try to do everything at once. You could run into difficulties that require help from others who may be unavailable. Control the urge to steamroll through your chores.",Leo
"Aug 11, 2022 - Unusual circumstances could arise that change your creative orientation, Leo. It's likely that they involve the gathering, sharing, and using of information. You may consider some unusual options that involve changing jobs, home, or another factor important to you. Think carefully first. Enjoy an intimate evening sharing these new developments with someone special.",Leo
"Aug 12, 2022 - Words of love could be exchanged between you and your romantic interest today, Leo. Obstacles to open and honest communication have been cleared away in the past few weeks. You'll both be more apt than usual to express your feelings. The only caveat is to not lay it on too thick. Even now, getting too mushy could be off-putting for your partner. Be discreet and enjoy your day.",Leo
"Aug 13, 2022 - Projects involving a group, perhaps your entire community, could take up a lot of your time, Leo. Interesting news and stimulating conversations could come your way. Expect a lot of activity around you. You could be running around in the car, seeing people, getting errands taken care of. You could also find yourself changed somewhat - for the better, of course.",Leo
"Aug 14, 2022 - You may be bursting with energy and yearning to be a free spirit, Leo. At the same time, your emotions could find a way to block these thoughts. You may feel like there's some sort of weight holding you down, making it difficult to act freely. This could cause you to act fitfully, leaving you frustrated and defeated. Calm down and take things one step at a time.",Leo
"Aug 15, 2022 - Friends seeking advice or a shoulder to cry on may be plentiful today, Leo. And you're one of best people to provide the support and caring they need. Just don't give so much to others that you have nothing left for yourself. True friendship is about sharing problems. Getting rundown will leave you in a place where you aren't much help to anyone.",Leo
"Aug 16, 2022 - If you lack a regular exercise routine, Leo, today's a great day to remedy that. Exercise doesn't have to exhaust you or hurt. Even activities like walking or yoga are excellent ways to stay healthy. Play a sport that appeals to you and you combine fun with exercise. Even dancing is a fantastic means of exercise. Find something that works for you.",Leo
"Aug 17, 2022 - Leo, consider channeling your philosophical inspirations into creative writing, Leo. It's probably something you'll enjoy. Even if you haven't expressed yourself in this way before, there's no better day than today to give it a whirl. Try your hand at poetry or fiction. If that seems too daunting, start a journal. This will give you a place to collect your thoughts and insights.",Leo
"Aug 18, 2022 - Get into doing things today, Leo. Activities that require focus or creativity are supported. Your physical strength and energy will compel you to do something active. If you've been feeling tired or under the weather, this can put an end to it. Consider artistic projects that take strength, such as building something out of wood or carving. Make something special for someone.",Leo
"Aug 19, 2022 - Try to see nightmares as safe ways to understand feelings, Leo. No one likes to experience them, and we'd sooner forget them once awake, the quickest way to ensure they don't return is to understand what they're saying. Fear, pain, and anxiety are the most common ingredients of nightmares. What frightens you? Do you feel insecure? Consider the questions and probe for answers.",Leo
"Aug 20, 2022 - Today's energy can have you feeling ready for anything, Leo. Given your more radical approach, you may need to keep in check. Humanitarianism is part of your being, so if the pursuit of something you want hurts others, it would be a serious contradiction. Think through your actions before following through to ensure that you remain true to your ethical standards.",Leo
"Aug 21, 2022 - Things are coming to a critical point for you today, Leo, and you may find that other people openly object to your actions. It's OK to be a bit selfish if the situation is appropriate. Look at yourself in the mirror and be proud of the person you see. Try not to get lost in the group or think that your personal success and happiness depend on the success of others.",Leo
"Aug 22, 2022 - The day's general mood should fit quite well with your agenda, Leo. There's no need to fixate on the negative. Keep things light and upbeat and worry about the consequences later. This is the time to be adventurous and explore. Don't let anyone else tell you how to run your show. You have a strong will and strong opinions, so don't be afraid to express either.",Leo
"Aug 23, 2022 - Social events could put you in touch with interesting people in intriguing professions, Leo. You might get involved in some fascinating conversations that provide you with a lot of useful information. Some of what you hear could be so bizarre that you find it difficult to believe. New friendships or groups could result from this interaction, so get contact information. Enjoy!",Leo
"Aug 24, 2022 - A friend you may not have seen for a while could awaken strange new feelings for which you're unprepared, Leo. You may see this person as a potential romantic partner. What you do about it depends on your situation. It probably isn't a good idea to pursue this attraction today. It may pass. Wait a few days. If it's still there, who knows?",Leo
"Aug 25, 2022 - You may feel a strong connection with your fanciful, romantic side today, Leo. Dreams and illusions are apt to enter the scene and take you into the clouds. Be careful, because you might find that a strong aggressive force opposes these dreams. Your wit and connection with new technology and electrical gadgets will be your greatest assets on a day like today.",Leo
"Aug 26, 2022 - You can probably sweet-talk your way in or out of any situation today, Leo. You have a great deal of power within, and you can accomplish anything as long as you aren't afraid to use it. Don't fear failure. If you never try, you'll never succeed. If you see missing pieces in the plan, don't worry. Trust that things will fall into place as needed. Keep your eyes on the prize.",Leo
"Aug 27, 2022 - Even though you probably aren't getting on a plane today, Leo, you would love to at some point in the future. Your wanderlust is back and you're bound for the wild blue yonder yet again, most likely to someplace exotic. Enjoy the time away, but do come back. It seems that sometimes your spirit of adventure dampens your enjoyment of the more mundane but more real daily life.",Leo
"Aug 28, 2022 - Your home could be empty today, Leo. Other household members may be away and you could find it depressing. Instead of enjoying the solitude, you could feel like the walls are closing in around you. The only answer is to go out for a while. Take a walk or visit some bookstores or antique shops, if possible. Don't go home until you're too tired to do anything else. Try to have fun.",Leo
"Aug 29, 2022 - Circumstances are changing regarding your professional goals, Leo. You may have been thinking about a change for a long time, but someone you meet today, perhaps in a social or casual situation, could provide the motivation you need to finally decide. This isn't just the result of outer changes. You've been changing inside, too. You aren't the same person you were when you chose your current job.",Leo
"Aug 30, 2022 - Pay attention to your body today and feel free to stop when your body says to stop, Leo. There's a strong aggressive force asking you to take action in one way or another. Make sure that you are considerate of others. Most importantly, make sure that you are considerate of yourself. Don't indulge in cheap thrills at the expense of your physical well-being.",Leo
"Aug 31, 2022 - You're drawn to public service, Leo. This desire propels you to volunteer your services with a group of some kind. You may feel a bit awkward at first, but your natural leadership abilities will soon kick in. The group will be left wondering how they ever managed without you. Your talent shines through once again. Well done!",Leo
"Sep 1, 2022 - Use the morning to take care of yourself, Leo. You could be so concerned with the world and the shared environment that you forget to take care of you. Use the early afternoon to reflect and meditate. Gather facts from your inner state and use the information to create a plan for the future. Be flexible in your approach.",Leo
"Sep 2, 2022 - Today you're likely to be working hard behind the scenes, perhaps preparing a project for others to make public or coaching people for some kind of virtual performance. You'll expend a lot of energy in the course of completing this chore, yet you'll probably feel it was all worth it. Don't expect to go home early, Leo. You'll probably go above and beyond the call of duty.",Leo
"Sep 3, 2022 - Bizarre, unexpected developments might turn your life upside down today, Leo. Money could be involved. New people could arrive who open doors that eventually lead to a new life. You could even fall in love at first sight. It isn't easy to make predictions for a strange day like this. Rest assured that when you go to bed you won't be the same person you were when you woke up.",Leo
"Sep 4, 2022 - Put some of your fantastic ideas to good use today, Leo. It's one thing to be a genius with plenty of masterpieces floating around in your head. It's quite another to actually put things into motion. You may be full of talk, but today it's important to be full of action. Restriction and limitation are creeping in, so do what you can to get things in place before it's too late.",Leo
"Sep 5, 2022 - Sudden and unexpected changes could have you feeling a bit confused, disoriented, and doubtful about the future, Leo. Relax! The changes may be not only beneficial for your career but also for your finances. Don't think those in authority haven't noticed your skills and ingenuity. In fact, you may receive some sincere compliments and gratitude.",Leo
"Sep 6, 2022 - Your mind is likely to be going a thousand miles an hour. Ideas for imaginative and innovative projects may come faster than you can possibly turn them into reality. Write them down. You may not have time to work on them now, but you will later. You could decide to attend a virtual lecture, sign up for an online class, or make plans to join friends and attend another kind of small group activity, if possible.",Leo
"Sep 7, 2022 - A family member may be depressed and not up for talking about what's wrong. His or her mood could spread to everyone else, so it might be a good idea to ask what's wrong. Point out that moods are contagious! Don't force the issue, Leo. That would be worse. A number of calls could interrupt your work, which you might find irritating. Don't be afraid to let voicemail get the calls.",Leo
"Sep 8, 2022 - Things should be going quite well for you today, Leo, especially in the love and romance department. You'll find that there is a magical, adventuresome spirit when you connect with others. Take advantage of this courageous energy and put it to good use in whatever way you see fit. Bring an extra element of excitement into your world tonight with someone very special to you.",Leo
"Sep 9, 2022 - An exciting communication could inform you of an advancement opportunity that you should explore. While you'd be quick to act under normal circumstances, Leo, today you might be more cautious. You've sought recognition for a while, so don't be too reticent. Don't let your insecurity get the better of you. Learn all you can about the situation and then make an informed decision.",Leo
"Sep 10, 2022 - A rising tide lifts all boats. When someone close experiences a windfall or especially good luck, Leo, the ripple effect reaches you. Change is in the air. While everything happening is positive, sometimes it feels like it's going too quickly. You feel a bit off balance, with little or no time to adjust. Even windfalls take some getting used to. Give yourself time to settle into the new circumstances.",Leo
"Sep 11, 2022 - Normally you tend to view things on a logical, intellectual level, Leo, but today the strength of your intuition could surprise you. Your communications could be subtler than words.

Enjoy!",Leo
"Sep 14, 2022 - There may be an area of your life that seems completely fanciful now, Leo. The issues regarding it have become a bit hazy. You may no longer be sure of the reality of the situation. Today's energies will bring these issues into focus. Your emotions are especially heightened, and they, too, will seem a bit clouded. Try to stay balanced and gain a new perspective on the situation.",Leo
"Sep 15, 2022 - Call or write a letter to a friend today, Leo. Your brain may feel like it's stuck in a rut, which is probably best remedied by sharing these feelings with others. Take it one step at a time, and be patient with others in return. People are likely to snap more easily since fuses will be extra short. Take care as you approach the deep end. Make sure you have your life jacket on.",Leo
"Sep 16, 2022 - A pleasant surprise comes your way when you receive either a present or small sum of money, perhaps in the mail, Leo. Someone will either pay you back a loan or you could receive a gift for some small service you performed for someone. You could be tempted to turn that around and buy a present for someone else. Expect some calls that result in long and meaningful conversations.",Leo
"Sep 17, 2022 - An affectionate letter, phone call, or email could come to you from an old friend, Leo, expressing gratitude for past favors. This is going to make you feel warm and loving toward this person, and you'll want to reciprocate in kind. Invite him or her for coffee and have a long conversation. The bond between you is strong. This isn't a friendship you'll want to let go.",Leo
"Sep 18, 2022 - Are you looking for a particular piece of information, Leo? A friend, possibly another Leo, has this information but is unaware that you're searching for it. Don't be afraid to let all your friends and acquaintances know that you need to find some specific facts. The person who finally comes forward may surprise you. Enjoy your day!",Leo
"Sep 19, 2022 - You can't ask for a better day, Leo. Positive energy is coming your way. You should look for the opportunities that are right in front of you. You may be going through some significant upheaval right now. Clear away all the things that have limited you in the past. The future is wide open. Empower yourself to make the changes necessary to build your life way you want it to be.",Leo
"Sep 20, 2022 - Have you been feeling stagnant lately, Leo, as if your life is going nowhere? What happens today could change that. An unusual group event could put you in touch with people who open new intellectual, career, or spiritual doors for you. Stimulating conversations could turn your head toward opportunities that you were never aware of before. Onward and upward!",Leo
"Sep 21, 2022 - A virtual conference of some kind could touch upon some pretty volatile issues, Leo. People could disagree to the point that the meeting turns into a shouting match.

Think about it!",Leo

Don't let your caution bog you down at the moment. It could be surprisingly wonderful.",Leo
"Sep 23, 2022 - You should be looking especially attractive, Leo. You may have an ethereal, mystical look about you that attracts attention from strangers. This won't be lost on your friends, either. You could find it unsettling, particularly if people get too attentive or if a love partner gets jealous. Relax and enjoy it anyway. Needless to say, this is a great day to shop online for clothes!",Leo
"Sep 24, 2022 - Working late, Leo? What could be so important that it keeps you from paying attention to your family or partner? Probably nothing! Take a good, objective look at what you think must be done tonight. You'll probably find that your company won't go broke if you leave some tasks. Get as much done as you can and then go home to your loved ones. They're important, too!",Leo

Enjoy your day.",Leo
"Sep 28, 2022 - It has been said that you can never have too many friends, Leo, but today you might wonder if perhaps you do. Your phone could be ringing off the hook. One person after another will be soliciting you for advice and your famous shoulder to cry on. Be patient. One day you may need that person to be there for you. Try to listen and keep your sense of humor about you.",Leo
"Sep 29, 2022 - You think of yourself as a practical person, Leo, but today your thoughts may turn to the mystical and spiritual. Your intuition is strong now, letting you tune in to the feelings of your loved ones. This allows you to be empathetic and understanding, which your partner especially appreciates. Your intuition may inspire you to approach a problem in a new way. Let your mind wander and see what develops.",Leo
"Sep 30, 2022 - Don't be surprised if a lot of people contact you today, each one anxious to confer with you. It seems that you're the authority on all topics, Leo. All the attention is flattering, but it makes it difficult to get any work done. Do what you can to help your co-workers, and then tell them that the help desk is closed for the day. You want to leave work early so you can be with your loved ones.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Oct 1, 2022 - An unexpected letter or package might arrive sometime today, Leo. This could be a gift from a lover - perhaps a bit more lavish than you would have expected. You could receive other communications as well. At least one could be related to your job in some way. A virtual party invitation could also come, and you will probably want to attend. A significant other will want to join you.",Leo
"Oct 2, 2022 - Be aggressive and forceful when it comes to exerting your will, Leo. Let others know that you won't be a pushover. Your opinions are extremely important, and they need to be heard by the people who matter the most. Have faith that whatever you say has the power to come true, especially when you enlist the help of those around you. Opportunity lies in joining hands with others.",Leo
"Oct 3, 2022 - You may feel as if your hands are tied today and you're faced with absolutely no options, Leo. Don't despair over a situation that seems insurmountable. Think of yourself as a terrific magician who can burst out of the strongest chains. You have tricks up your sleeve that can help you escape just about any situation in which you find yourself.",Leo
"Oct 4, 2022 - Imagination and fantasy play a big part in your thinking today, Leo, and you shouldn't hesitate to embrace this frame of mind. There's a great deal of power to be drawn from your sense of freedom to explore and dream. Your thinking is more of a higher consciousness now. You should take advantage of this lofty perspective to see things from a neutral viewpoint.",Leo
"Oct 5, 2022 - A love relationship could take on a higher and more spiritual aspect during this period, creating a desire for your souls to bond. The planetary atmosphere brings you closer together, and you may experience a closer sense of intimacy. You two might spend time with mutual friends today, if possible, enjoying yourselves, but at the same time anxious to be alone. Bask in the glow.",Leo
"Oct 6, 2022 - Your fairytale imagination of how your romantic life should run is hooking you up with many different opportunities, Leo. Whether you realize it or not, the optimal situation you seek is within your grasp. Make sure that you aren't trying to manipulate a certain person into becoming the person you want him or her to be. If you're unhappy in your relationship, perhaps you need to find someone new.",Leo
"Oct 7, 2022 - Restriction and discipline might not be your forte, Leo, but realize that this may be exactly the type of thing that you need the most. Try not to expend your energy in too many directions. Focus and channel your efforts into the things you consider the most important. Make sure that most of your day is spent tending to these things. Have you hugged your loved ones lately?",Leo
"Oct 8, 2022 - You're on a roll today, Leo. Don't let other people's insecurities or shallow understanding about an issue get in the way of your progress. There's a distinct advantage to the way you approach things. Feel free to exert your will on those who need strong direction. If you're confident about the answer, don't be shy about saying so. If people don't like the way you're leading, they don't need to follow.",Leo
"Oct 9, 2022 - You might have difficulty expressing your needs, Leo. The bottom line is that there's no right or wrong way, although it may be difficult to see this on a day like today. Deep-seated insecurity may make expressing yourself difficult. At a time when you feel like you should politely take things in, you really may be feeling like you want to run from the people around you.",Leo
"Oct 10, 2022 - Your sweetheart may seem upset today and unlikely to want to talk about it, Leo. This could prove frustrating for you since you don't like to be kept in the dark. Take care to avoid giving in to the temptation to push. This won't make your partner any more likely to share, and it could drive a wedge between you. Just hang in there and let your friend talk when the time is right.",Leo
"Oct 11, 2022 - Today you might decide to do some writing, Leo. This could be job related, but it's more likely personal, either correspondence with friends and colleagues or creative. Some stimulating discussion could take place with friends, romantic partners, or children that could set your mind buzzing with new ideas. This is a great day to attend or participate in a solo sport.",Leo
"Oct 12, 2022 - Today you might decide to buy a plant for every room in your house or plant a garden, Leo. If the weather is good, you might visit a nursery or botanical garden. You may not normally be attracted to plants and gardens, but today both beauty and nature seem especially appealing. Make the most of this, however temporary. Your house will look that much more beautiful because of it!",Leo
"Oct 13, 2022 - If possible, a get-together of some kind could take place today either at your home or the home of someone close to you, Leo. It could even turn into more than just a fun time. You might become involved in conversations with people who become valuable business or social contacts. Expect to have a wonderful time no matter what you do today.",Leo
"Oct 14, 2022 - This is going to be a good moment to look elsewhere, Leo. You should do just as the artist does when he has worked too long on a painting, which is to take a step back. You need to clear your head. Go for a walk. Call a mentor. Text with an artist friend. Breaks are never easy for you, but do it anyway. Afterwards you'll think it was the best thing for you.",Leo
"Oct 15, 2022 - Your physical energy is likely to be high today, Leo, so you might not feel like staying indoors. Take care of your body first, and get in a good workout. You may also want to explore, perhaps by driving out of town for the day or going to an amusement park, if possible. You may not feel this energetic very often, so it's best to make the most of it when you can.",Leo
"Oct 16, 2022 - People may come into conflict with you today, Leo. More than likely, the issue at hand will have to do with others being a bit too focused on themselves, while you're more concerned with the collective. Try to be a bit more understanding as people demand more of your attention. There's an unmistakable passion in the air that will grant you more zest for life.",Leo
"Oct 17, 2022 - Communication is flowing smoothly today, Leo, so take advantage of this and get the word out. It's important for you to make connections with other people now. Run with your instincts and feel free to enter into debates. Your words and tone of voice are very convincing. You could sell anything to anyone today.",Leo
"Oct 18, 2022 - You may know exactly the right thing to do today, but for some reason, the action required may be a hard thing for you to implement, Leo. Take an active role to get involved. Say your peace, but don't get so attached to the results that you get upset and discouraged if things don't exactly work out according to plan. Independence is an important virtue to hold onto today.",Leo
"Oct 19, 2022 - Getting your opinions out now may stir up the maelstrom even more, but ultimately, it's for the best, Leo. There is an explosive tone in the air right now that's difficult to ignore. You need your strong will to combat the abrasive forces at work today. You have the opportunity to initiate control over the situation. Other people might be too unsure of themselves to make a move.",Leo
"Oct 20, 2022 - Work toward achieving a better unity between you and the people around you, Leo. It could be that certain people in your circle of friends somehow feel alienated in one way or another. Perhaps they don't feel like they fit in with the rest of the group. Remind yourself and others that everyone is unique and that all should be equally accepted despite individual differences.",Leo
"Oct 21, 2022 - This is a tremendously expansive time for you, Leo, and there is very little that will stop your momentum once you get going. Your eyes are alive with a spark that says that you're ready to take on the world. Believe this about yourself and others will believe in you. There is a great deal of luck on your side today, so take a gamble in a certain part of your life.",Leo
"Oct 22, 2022 - Today you might be able to tune in to the thoughts and feelings of others, Leo, but you aren't likely to know exactly how to handle the situation. Should you say something or just tailor your own behavior to suit the moods of others? Reflect on the situation before doing either. This is a great day to meditate or read books or attend online lectures on spiritual matters.",Leo
"Oct 23, 2022 - Conversations of various kinds could take place today, Leo. Some older people, perhaps your parents, could call you. It may be a rather quiet visit, with conversation that's more casual than intense, but it will be nice, nonetheless. Later you could get in touch with friends or colleagues to offer congratulations regarding something exciting.",Leo
"Oct 24, 2022 - A surprising revelation, either from within or from sources like books, the Internet, or communications from others could set you in an entirely new direction. You will have an increased sense of freedom, as well as a clearer and more progressive outlook. You might consider some pretty heavy changes in your life, Leo, but don't make any final decisions or arrangements today. Wait before putting your ideas into action.",Leo
"Oct 25, 2022 - Today your intellect is flying high, Leo. A number of new ideas, perhaps about political or social issues, might excite your curiosity and cause you to want to spend hours in the library or on the Internet. Mundane tasks still need handling, however. This might be frustrating because it takes you away from your quest. If you get the basics done quickly, you can return without causing any undue guilt.",Leo
"Oct 26, 2022 - A surprising revelation from a friend or acquaintance might wake you up to the fact that you don't really know this person as well as you thought you did. Information could set you off on a search for knowledge that keeps you occupied for hours. A child or young person could come to you and ask for help. This promises to be a busy but interesting day, Leo. Make the most of it!",Leo
"Oct 27, 2022 - Practical thoughts may be the result of unconscious impulses brought to the surface by events at home. Old traumas and phobias could be released, although you should take care to not dwell on them too much or you'll reinforce them instead of getting rid of them. Your imagination is flying high. You might focus it on decorating your house. You could find antiques especially appealing.",Leo
"Oct 28, 2022 - An older male visitor could contact you, possibly offering to help you with some work that needs to be done. Family members may have abandoned you for the day to go out and do their own thing. You will welcome the offer. Practical matters, such as the household budget, might need attention, so set aside some time to work out the details.",Leo
"Oct 29, 2022 - Today you may not feel much like working, and you might even decide to play hooky from your responsibilities, Leo. If you have nothing urgent to do, consider indulging this whim. Relax with a good book and a cup of tea. Watch a favorite movie. Take a long walk in a beautiful park. In the evening, cuddle with a love partner. Savor the day's gentle energy.",Leo
"Oct 30, 2022 - Try not to overanalyze your actions, Leo. If you continue to pick apart every aspect, you will end up getting nowhere. This principle applies to your emotions, too. Be sure that you aren't trying to make rational sense out of every feeling that comes your way. Feelings are there for you to experience. Allow them to flow through your heart and not necessarily your head.",Leo
"Oct 31, 2022 - A new cycle is beginning for you in which you may find yourself throwing away old beliefs and mental processes, Leo. Out with the old and in with the new. This time of housecleaning is extremely important, for you will find that the same tired old speech that you've been working on is suddenly defunct. Pull your resources together and construct a new platform that makes you proud.",Leo
"Nov 1, 2022 - The hungrier you get, the more determined you will become, Leo. Be careful that your determination doesn't turn into desperation and neediness. It's unattractive and will get you nowhere. Keep on the upward spiral, and let determination turn into inspiration and cooperation. You will find this especially true when it comes to matters of the heart. You have a great deal of power. Put it to good use.",Leo
"Nov 2, 2022 - Today you might be a bit worried about your financial affairs, Leo. A past mistake could have led to some rather upsetting consequences. Now you need to harness every bit of skill you have in order to set things straight. Your knowledge of modern technology could help. A friend might try to pick a quarrel with you, but it's best to stay cool, neutral, and out of the discussion.",Leo
"Nov 3, 2022 - Today you may want to change some of the moral and social values that get in the way of relationships. After surmounting these kinds of obstacles yourself, and watching others struggle with them, you've decided that it's time to do away with them once and for all. Just be careful to respect the private lives of the people close to you. Not everyone is as open-minded as you are!",Leo
"Nov 4, 2022 - Today's aspects ask you to make more of an effort, Leo. You will have to come back down to Earth and join the rest of us mere mortals. You may be cultivating your independence a bit too much. It pulls you away from people. You should try to mingle and get involved in a cause that's bigger than you. Working with others is a necessary part of any job.",Leo
"Nov 5, 2022 - Today is ideal for romance, Leo. It's great for forming new relationships or improving existing ones. If you don't have a special someone, make an effort to expand your social circle. Attend a lecture or take a workshop. If you have a mate, do something different together that helps you get to know one another better. A spiritual retreat might be just the boost your relationship needs.",Leo
"Nov 6, 2022 - Consider subscribing to an alternative newsletter of some sort, Leo. You will find some amazing information that the general public doesn't necessarily know. Knowledge is power. For the most part, common knowledge is quite limited. Try to seek news from a wider community. Some mainstream information is pretty unreliable.",Leo
"Nov 7, 2022 - If you're waiting for someone to come and fill all of your needs, emotional ones in particular, you may have to wait a very long time! You're responsible for fulfilling your own needs, Leo. If you don't, you will be eternally dependent. This would be unlike Leo, and certainly unlike you!",Leo
"Nov 8, 2022 - If you aren't careful to keep your eyes straight ahead and focused on the future, the past is likely to catch up to you, Leo. Don't look back, even if you don't see anything in front of you. You must continue to move forward. It's true that this is easier said than done. Nevertheless, you feel inspired to give it a try.",Leo
"Nov 9, 2022 - Now is the time to be thinking about your professional orientation, Leo. You may need to get some more fun in your life and experience pleasures that you've never had before. You have a certain tendency to separate the two worlds of work and play, but there's no need. In fact, your work will prosper once you discover ways to make it more playful.",Leo
"Nov 10, 2022 - Today might be a little rough for you, Leo. It's as if reality were waiting to trip you up. Nothing about you is realistic. If you're still a bit childish or irresponsible, today may be rather hard on you. It's nothing serious, so don't worry. However, if you feel as though your back is to the wall, don't react. Try to calmly accept what's happening to you.",Leo
"Nov 11, 2022 - Most of the time it's good to have strong opinions and be independent and willful, Leo. But there are other times when this attitude turns people away you're hoping to draw closer. There's a stubborn yet sensitive attitude in your world of romance that may be difficult for you to deal with. Perhaps you're taking a more rational approach to things while your loved one is taking a more emotional one.",Leo
"Nov 12, 2022 - Today you could put a stop to your activities for a little while, Leo. You may take a good, hard look at things and realize that the climate of trust you need in order to be productive and creative is missing at the moment. It's a good time to get some order back into your relationships and remind others of their responsibilities to you.",Leo
"Nov 13, 2022 - Whatever goals you've been trying to reach may finally become reality today, Leo. Finalizing everything could involve a lot of running around in the car and meeting with other people, but you're likely to feel exhilarated all the same. Powerful people could prove to be of valuable help to you. As a result, matters should be going very well right now. Make the most of it!",Leo
"Nov 14, 2022 - Today you should be looking and feeling great. You might attract some admiring looks from passersby on the street. Sex and romance might be on your mind, Leo. You're likely to want to spend the day with your special someone. You could also channel those feelings into creative activities of some kind. Information may come your way that sets your mental juices flowing. Make the most of it!",Leo
"Nov 15, 2022 - Today you may meet a new friend, Leo. People tend to feel comfortable around you even if they're different than you are. That's because you usually accept the fact that everyone is different and that's OK. This is a rare and special quality - not everyone is as open-minded as you! Plan to do something with your new friend or hang out with another special person, if possible. There will be no lack of people interested in spending time with you.",Leo
"Nov 16, 2022 - You might find it rather tough to take criticism today, Leo. This is something that's hard for many to hear, but it truly depends on your perspective. Rather than view it as a personal attack, try to see the value in the criticism. If you're honest with yourself and recognize that you could learn and grow from critique, seize it as an opportunity. If you find that it's out in left field, then leave it there.",Leo
"Nov 17, 2022 - Matters of love and romance should be going well, but try not to overdo it, Leo. Be careful of getting so caught up in the fantasy of romance that you fail to take care of the details. Today is a good day to get the foundation solid before you start building. If you've already started building, you may need to stand back and consider areas in which some extra support beams may be necessary.",Leo
"Nov 18, 2022 - Are you thinking of going into business for yourself, Leo? Being self-employed doesn't automatically mean you will have more freedom. Of course, you will be your own boss, but you will also bear all the responsibility for the success or failure of your enterprise. If you quit, the whole thing will collapse. Think about it. Base your decision on reality and not fantasy.",Leo
"Nov 19, 2022 - Some days it's better to be on vacation! That's what you're liable to think today. All your projects are mired in quicksand, and you feel like you're spinning your wheels. But even if things are momentarily stuck, don't lose faith. Your inner self is gaining stability. When the time is right, it will be strong and reliable.",Leo
"Nov 20, 2022 - The day ahead will be a soothing one, Leo. Since it's auspicious for the material aspect of things, it's a good time to settle household issues like bills or repairs. But you might also take advantage of today's aspect to set in motion even more ambitious plans about your living situation. Is it time to think more seriously about that move you've been dreaming of?",Leo
"Nov 21, 2022 - Social events, possibly involving small groups, could put you in touch with knowledgeable people who could provide valuable information. You might decide to go back to school or otherwise advance your education. Technology could play a large part in all this, Leo, so it might be a good idea to work on your computer skills and bring them up to snuff. A short trip could be in the offing.",Leo
"Nov 22, 2022 - This is the end of the voyage you've been on over the past few weeks, Leo. You undoubtedly saw some interesting sights. Whether you were on an inner or outer voyage, the cosmic energy will bring you to a safe harbor. Unpack your bags carefully, as they're filled with treasures and souvenirs. You will want to put them around the house as happy reminders of how much you've grown.",Leo
"Nov 23, 2022 - You may be barking up the wrong tree today, Leo. Before you waste all your energy on your podium proclaiming your thoughts to the world, it would behoove you to stop, look around, and notice your audience. How are they reacting to your tirade? Are people walking away or are they cheering? Perhaps you need to let someone else have a turn at the microphone.",Leo
"Nov 24, 2022 - An older visitor might come to your door today, Leo. You aren't likely to be too thrilled about this, but you will be able to play the good host anyway. Romance and sociability may be a bit limited by obligations to family, particularly parents, but don't let it get you down. You may be stuck at home tonight, but you will be able to let loose later.",Leo
"Nov 25, 2022 - Your opinions might be the topic of conversation all day, Leo. You have a very strong will and you aren't afraid to express it. Today you will get that chance. Feel free to enlighten others with your tremendous wealth of knowledge. Take control of the conversation and accept the mental challenge of trying to win other people over to your side. Whether you're successful or not, you will have fun trying.",Leo
"Nov 26, 2022 - You've been a social butterfly lately, Leo! The sociable phase you're currently in demands a great deal of energy. You're attracted to some of your new acquaintances but irritated by others. One in particular causes you real anxiety today. You have two choices. Either abandon your new group of friends entirely or expel the person who's causing you trouble.",Leo
"Nov 27, 2022 - Expect to be torn between two seemingly paradoxical urges today, Leo. Part of you wants to spend the day wrapped in a cocoon, playing with your toys. But another side of you is just as committed to spearheading a major creative or social endeavor with friends who share your revolutionary ideas. You feel exhausted from trying to build the perfect world.",Leo
"Nov 28, 2022 - Things are looking up for you, Leo, especially later in the day. Pieces should be coming together and things flowing into place naturally. You will find that your outward-directed energy is better balanced now. You should connect with others using your keen wit, strong will, and sheer intelligence. Take your time to do the things you need to do. Don't rush.",Leo
"Nov 29, 2022 - You're apt to be spurred into action by strong forces that don't want you to take a break, Leo. Keep in mind that the more you resist, the more you will be pushed and pulled by outside sources. If you find yourself in a bind, take a deep breath and calm down. Act from a point of neutrality instead of a point of anger or defensiveness.",Leo
"Nov 30, 2022 - This is going to be a good moment to look elsewhere, Leo. You should do just as the artist does when he has worked on a painting for too long, which is take a step back. You need to see some people, travel, go to the theater, and clear your head. This is never easy for you, but don't hesitate. You will realize afterward that it was the best thing for you to do.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Leo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",Leo
"Dec 1, 2022 - Spiritual and metaphysical studies may take up a lot of your time today, Leo. You might want to dig into the world's major religions or try to make it through works about spiritualism or the occult. If you want to, this is the day to do it because your concentration is very strong, although it will be necessary to take a lot of breaks!",Leo
"Dec 2, 2022 - You should find that you have an extra amount of creative energy now, Leo, and you should do what you can to make this force work for you. There's a time and place for everything, and now is the time to work together with your higher self to channel some of the artist within. Don't let your self-doubt keep you from using the creative force that's brewing inside you.",Leo
"Dec 3, 2022 - Today is one of those days in which prosperity is much closer than you think, Leo. You will find what you seek, but it's up to you to take the first step to going after it. More than likely, you're looking for solid answers to your deep and probing questions. Don't let your inquisitive mind rest until you find the answers that ring true for you.",Leo
"Dec 4, 2022 - No matter what you're doing today, have fun, Leo. Whistle a tune. Turn the stereo up to full volume and dance around the kitchen as you make dinner. You can find amusement in just about anything, so keep this in mind as you tackle even the menial tasks. You're responsible for your own attitude, so don't blame anyone else for a sour mood. Turn yourself around and have fun.",Leo
"Dec 5, 2022 - You should find that the adventurous side of you has the support of your emotions, Leo. These two parts of your spirit are working in harmony to help you stretch beyond your limits. Push into new realms and ask questions when you don't understand something. This is the only way you will learn, develop, and grow mentally and emotionally. Don't assume learning stops when you leave school.",Leo
"Dec 6, 2022 - The day ahead should be excellent, Leo. For the past several days you've been searching for meaning in life. There have been changes in your chief occupation, new relationships, bursting ambitions. Today you can let all of that soul-searching go. You're likely to whip up a huge mixture of the whole experience and be grateful for the thrilling life you lead right now!",Leo
"Dec 7, 2022 - You can expect to be volatile today, Leo! No one will dare contradict you or insinuate that you've taken your ideas from others. You have the potential to get really angry. Rather than say things you might later regret, write down your thoughts. And if you do feel the need to make a speech, do it publicly.",Leo
"Dec 8, 2022 - Self-control is the word for today, Leo. Others' unethical behavior could trigger some long-buried anger that might make you want to lash out at those responsible. This won't solve anything. The best way to handle these rather explosive emotions is honest communication, but today it could deteriorate into arguments. Try counting to ten before confronting anyone. It works!",Leo
"Dec 9, 2022 - Spiritual goals may be at the top of your priority list now, Leo. You may be looking for online metaphysical seminars or meditation workshops, perhaps taking place in a distant state or foreign country. You're likely to find it difficult to make a decision about any options right now. Whatever you're considering, make sure you know all the facts before making a choice of any kind.",Leo
"Dec 10, 2022 - A problem with your house - plumbing, electricity, phones - might necessitate calling in professionals, Leo. This might prove mildly irritating, as strangers could be going in and out all day, and you or other members of your household might be temporarily housebound when you have obligations elsewhere. Don't take your frustrations out on others. This will all pass by tomorrow!",Leo
"Dec 11, 2022 - As you try to express your opinions today, you may have the feeling that someone is kicking sand in your face, Leo. Like a kid on the beach, you have nothing but the raw elements to use to defend yourself. Use one of your greatest gifts - the power of your mind - to combat the opposing force. Your ability to outsmart others will be your most powerful tool.",Leo
"Dec 12, 2022 - Your emotions are soaring, Leo, and you should feel free to indulge in your greatest fantasies. Take a break from reality for a while. Let your inner child play. You should enjoy a greater self-confidence that you can use effectively to influence other people. Beware of anyone who asks you to make a solid commitment today. They may not exactly have your well-being in mind.",Leo
"Dec 13, 2022 - You will find that you relate very well to others today, Leo, and your communication will prove to be quite valuable. You may find yourself in the position of arbiter simply because you have the detached mind that people need to resolve disputes. Take an active role in the lives of those around you and see how your own life benefits from the generosity of your actions.",Leo
"Dec 14, 2022 - Today is a powerful day for you, Leo. Your emotions may be stubborn but realize the very thing you resist is the very thing you need the most. Consider making a major change that will help bring about a healthier balance between you and the people with whom you associate. It may be time for a whole new outlook on how you deal with your relationships.",Leo
"Dec 15, 2022 - Get the party started early in the day, Leo. You may be running from task to task, but this is OK. You have the ability to get a lot done by multitasking and keeping things light. As the day progresses, however, there will be a veil of restriction that slowly settles over your mood. You may find it harder to communicate your thoughts than it was earlier in the day.",Leo
"Dec 16, 2022 - It may be hard for you to get a project off the ground, Leo. Perhaps this is a sign that it needs to stay there. Take it back to the drawing board. Do some more planning and testing. Make sure that your actions are well thought out. Test the brakes before you drive down the mountain. You will find that you can accomplish a lot today if you stay focused and disciplined.",Leo
"Dec 17, 2022 - People may be somewhat selfish and self-centered today, but this doesn't mean that you have to follow suit, Leo. Remind others of the importance of the collective. We all need to pitch in and do our part to be happy. You have the ability to offer balance to the situation, and you should definitely put this to the test. Do what you can to make the scales tip back to center.",Leo
"Dec 18, 2022 - You don't live your life by society's rules, Leo. Your freedom is what is most important to you. But despite your independence, there are days when you have the sudden, sinking feeling that you could wind up alone in this world. Today you should really begin to think about what the word ""commitment"" means to you. Is it really so scary?",Leo
"Dec 19, 2022 - You've been working exceptionally hard, Leo. Today is a good day to recharge your batteries. It seems everyone wants a piece of you. You may have reached the point where you have nothing left to give. It's OK to say so. If possible, take the phone off the hook and reserve the day for yourself. Sleep in, meditate, go for a walk - you get the idea!",Leo
"Dec 20, 2022 - Your freedom is more important to you than anything else in your life. It's often very difficult for you to get involved, whether personally or professionally. Nevertheless, today you may have to think about it. Could it be that your thirst for freedom is just an escape? You may need to ponder this question. Who knows? You could decide to take the leap!",Leo
"Dec 21, 2022 - Try to curb your tongue today, Leo. There's no reason to lash out. You will find that the more sensitive your approach, the farther you will get in your pursuit of your goals. Today might find you feeling moody, and your emotions could be running away with you. Get in touch with your feelings rather than push them away. They're probably trying to tell you something important.",Leo
"Dec 22, 2022 - More than likely you will be caught up in a wildly intense emotional drama if you aren't careful, Leo. Try to stay calm and collected. Find a quiet, solitary place where you can relax. Your energy is there, but it may be more reserved and subtle on a day like this. Be the stable oasis in the raging turmoil. Make peace with the people around you.",Leo
"Dec 23, 2022 - You have strong psychic vision, Leo. Some people might say that you're prophetic, but your gift is a combination of creativity and intuition. You can use this to benefit others, and in fact have often done so. You're known for your good advice. Have some restraint today. People are listening closely to what you say. If you advise someone to do something crazy, they might do it!",Leo
"Dec 24, 2022 - This is an auspicious time for you, Leo. It gives you the energy and enthusiasm to make the necessary changes in your life. There is a lot of work to do, but you're up to it! First focus on your relationships. Your loved ones don't care about your professional successes. They want (and perhaps need) to spend more time with you. Do what you can to bring your life more into balance.",Leo
"Dec 25, 2022 - Try not to be too competitive today, Leo. The more you try to drive your point across, the more it will meet stubborn opposition. This is a better day to observe the situation. Emotions are running high, and people aren't necessarily acting rationally. It will do no good to try to reason with someone determined to fight. Save your ammunition for something else.",Leo
"Dec 26, 2022 - There's a restrictive, sober tone to the day that may wear you down, Leo. The trick to working this energy to your advantage is to adjust your game plan to fit the mood. Take care of mundane chores and small obstacles. Make realistic plans and follow through with short-term goals. Water your plants. Do things that require discipline and grounding.",Leo
"Dec 27, 2022 - In general, you tend to be critical of the way the government and politicians handle social issues and institutions. Your goal isn't just to criticize, however. You would also like to see some positive changes in these areas. The aura of understanding and comprehension in the air today helps you realize that if you want the world to evolve, you're going to have to get people to react.",Leo
"Dec 28, 2022 - Scientists seem to live in a world apart from the rest of us, Leo, and from the events in everyday life, because they're so absorbed in other realities. This is a lot like your universe. If you were a scientist, you might do what they sometimes do - make parallels, like those learned men who apply their scientific reasoning to events in the world by analogy. Tell us your theories!",Leo
"Dec 29, 2022 - You probably need society's or other people's approval in order to feel good about yourself, Leo. But your original personality and way of thinking are often hard for others to accept. You may need to make your ideas less crazy and a little more down to Earth and practical. This should be your goal over the next few days if you don't want to feel left out of things.",Leo
"Dec 30, 2022 - Things that you thought were obvious may not seem quite as clear as you'd like them to be, Leo. Be aware that there may be some intense opposition to your plans. Take care of other people and their emotions. You will find that a wall might suddenly go up, putting a harsh barrier between you and your goals. Consider your heart as well as your head.",Leo
"Dec 31, 2022 - You may need to let go and release your control, Leo. You know what you want, so just trust your intuition. If you continue to let your brain do all the work, you will probably miss valuable information that can only come when you slow down and look within. Connect with others on sensitive issues and feel free to let your guard down. Let your mind work freely.",Leo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo

This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2022 - Put your ambition into action today, Virgo. The day's planetary aspects should find you feeling energetic and positive. Make the most of this by taking steps toward your goals. As you know, if you don't actively pursue things, nothing will happen. The years can pass by so quickly and you wouldn't want to be sitting on a rocker wondering “what if.” Trust yourself and do what it takes. Everything starts with a single step.",Virgo
"Feb 5, 2022 - You might feel the need for some time to yourself today, Virgo. And why not take it? Chances are you’re surrounded by others most of the time, and when you don't take time to be alone with your thoughts and feelings, it can prove unhealthy for you. Taking care of your emotional well-being is critical, as you have a deeply sensitive nature. With continuous activity around you, there's no time to connect with this part of you. Make time today.",Virgo
"Feb 6, 2022 - Virgo, put some music on to get yourself going today, especially if you feel a little lonely. Music often has as strong an effect as conversation. This is because it provides an avenue for you to communicate with a deeper part of yourself. Your sensitive nature can find comfort and hope through harmonies and rhythms like nothing else. Pull out your favorites and listen, sing along, or even dance. Enjoy your day to the fullest!",Virgo
"Feb 7, 2022 - Focus on yourself today, Virgo. Yours is often an extremely giving nature. You can be compassionate to a fault, in that too much of your energy goes to helping solve others’ problems. Then you're left without enough focus for yourself and the things that are troubling you. See about spending some time alone to concentrate on any issues you have. Reach out to a trusted friend for guidance and support. Allow someone to nurture you for a change.",Virgo
"Feb 8, 2022 - It's a super day to make decisions, Virgo. You can sit on the fence for a little too long when it comes to serious choices. Seize the energy that flows from today's planetary aspects, make a list of things that need to be decided in the areas of work, relationships, and finances, and go down the list one by one. Don't be afraid of making a mistake. Better that than missing out entirely, don't you think?",Virgo
"Feb 9, 2022 - Expect a strong boost to your ego and self-confidence today, Virgo. Your physical and mental energies are very high, and you're apt to feel that you're capable of moving mountains. Take advantage of this new motivation while you can, since today you could make definite progress on any goal toward which you may be striving. The support and encouragement of friends and colleagues should prove invaluable. Go for the gold!",Virgo
"Feb 10, 2022 - A number of people in interesting fields, such as law, education, or writing and publishing, could cross your path today, Virgo. This could involve your job, or perhaps these people attend a social event that you host in your home. Either way, some fascinating and useful information could come your way that alters your thinking and nudges it subtly in a new direction. You'll want to make the most of it. Have fun!",Virgo
"Feb 11, 2022 - Visitors might come to your home today to discuss business of some kind, Virgo, perhaps job related, perhaps about an enterprise you're developing on your own. If you aren't careful, however, you could get caught up in conversations that are more social than practical and thus lose sight of the reasons you got together. Stay focused on the matter at hand and you could be pleasantly surprised at the results.",Virgo
"Feb 12, 2022 - Some days it may be hard for you to get motivated, Virgo, but if ever there were a day in which it was easier than others, this would be the day. You’ll find that your mind is quite attuned to the situation around you and that your sense of grounding is helping you manifest that which you wish to bring to life. There’s a sense of time restriction and limitation to the day that is prodding you to act now.",Virgo
"Feb 13, 2022 - Today you might be trying to learn about a new form of modern technology, perhaps computer related, Virgo, and you could find it too confusing for words. Your brain could be going into overload, so it's probably best to take it one step at a time! It's also important to remember to take breaks and clear your head. Too much information all at once could result in your not being able to absorb any of it.",Virgo
"Feb 14, 2022 - Some paperwork involving business enterprises could be executed today, Virgo, possibly in your home. This might be a new and unexpected development. It could have you feeling a bit disoriented, but try to pull yourself together and make the most of it. Whatever the opportunity, all signs say that it might prove quite successful, so don't let it pass you by. Go with the flow and see where it takes you. You could be pleasantly surprised!",Virgo
"Feb 15, 2022 - You’re very intuitive by nature, Virgo, and today you should be feeling especially so. Don't be surprised if you spontaneously tune in to the ideas and emotions of those around you, or even if you and someone else come up with the same words at the same time. Use your insights to increase your understanding of others. You might also find that they bring artistic inspiration and even advance your worldly ambitions.",Virgo
"Feb 16, 2022 - Obligations to others could incline you toward staying home today, Virgo, but important career issues could pull you in to work. This could cause some inner conflict, and you may have to face a choice. Only you can make that choice, but take care to be objective and take all the facts into consideration. Don't get yourself all emotionally worked up. This will only exacerbate the situation.",Virgo
"Feb 17, 2022 - You’re normally a very intuitive person, and today you may experience clairvoyance that could rival Jeane Dixon’s. You could be feeling especially attuned to other planes, and your dreams are likely to be powerful and vivid. Use the messages you receive to inspire creative pursuits. Try your hand at painting, music, or poetry. You might not only be amazed by the results but learn even more from the work itself.",Virgo
"Feb 18, 2022 - You may have a wonderful day today, Virgo. Your imagination, intuition, and creativity are all high, and inspiration for new artistic works could be filling your heart and brain. You'll be all too happy to discuss your ideas with anyone who shows an interest. The one dark spot in the day might be that a child, close friend, or lover goes into a snit because he or she feels ignored. Don't worry. They’ll come out of it.",Virgo
"Feb 19, 2022 - Your self-confidence could well be in the pits today, Virgo. Mistakes from the past could come back to haunt you, and you may be momentarily overcome by the fear that you'll make similar errors again. Force yourself to be objective before you drive yourself crazy. It could cause you some unnecessary problems. Try to realize that you’re unique and that you have skills and talents that set you apart from everyone.",Virgo
"Feb 20, 2022 - An older relative or neighbor may need your assistance today, Virgo. This is apt to be a very inconvenient time for someone to ask for help, because you have plenty of chores of your own. Nonetheless, you'll go to the rescue because that's your nature. Take care to plan your time carefully, pace yourself, and try not to do too much at once. That way you'll live to help again tomorrow.",Virgo
"Feb 21, 2022 - A pleasant outing could get delayed or cancelled due to an event entirely out of your control. Rather than having a fit, Virgo, you and your friends could seize the opportunity to do something completely wild and different. For example, you could take in a matinee of the scariest movie in town or finally try out that Ethiopian restaurant you've been hearing so much about. Today brings a perfect opportunity to make lemonade out of lemons.",Virgo
"Feb 22, 2022 - A change of profession may be in the stars for you, Virgo, or a change of hobby at the very least. The latest technological advances have really captured your interest. Making films, in particular, gets your creative juices flowing. Perhaps it's time to sign up for a weekend workshop or splurge on that video camera you've been eyeing. The diversion will do you a world of good.",Virgo
"Feb 23, 2022 - A friend or relative might propose some travel, Virgo, but today you don't even want to think about going to the grocery store. You won't feel much like talking to anyone, either. Your mind is probably on intellectual or metaphysical matters. You could just want to stay home and study those subjects all day. Tell your friend the idea of traveling sounds great and you'll discuss it later. That's all you can manage right now.",Virgo
"Feb 24, 2022 - You’re bubbling over with confidence and enthusiasm, Virgo. Not surprisingly, those around you respond in kind. Your smile is contagious, and you have people joking and laughing with you throughout the day. You’ll have much success in whatever you do today, although group efforts will likely prove more rewarding. Romance figures prominently in the evening, so make the most of it!",Virgo
"Feb 25, 2022 - Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to the high level of intuition you have. Today you may feel weighed down by some strange thoughts that enter your head. Only time will tell if they are true premonitions or simply weird daydreams. In the meantime, you’d probably be best served by ignoring them completely. Life is too short to play the ""what if"" game.",Virgo
"Feb 26, 2022 - Your career may be sidetracked by petty gossip, rumor, and office politics. It's likely that someone is pushing forward his or her agenda without any thought or concern for its impact on others. Do what you can to put a stop to such shenanigans, Virgo. There are times when it's appropriate to be the whistleblower, and this is one of them.",Virgo
"Feb 27, 2022 - A new creative project of some kind, perhaps involving modern technology, could set your career in a new direction, Virgo. This may be the break you've been hoping for, and you're apt to be very excited about it. Any new enterprise begun today is going to have its ups and downs, but all signs indicate that it will succeed. Consider the project carefully before making a decision. Then if it feels right, go for it!",Virgo
"Feb 28, 2022 - Money and friendship rarely mix, Virgo. Keep this in mind today if a friend hits you up for a loan. You'd be better off helping her strategize ways to earn more money. Much as you like to help the underdog, a temporary approach often does more harm than good. A quick loan won't help your friend's fundamental problem of compulsive spending. Offering to pay for counseling would be a gift of enduring value.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo

This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"Mar 1, 2022 - Your concentration should be high today, Virgo. You're likely to be more observant than usual. Don't be surprised if you find yourself noticing people and sensing their thoughts and feelings even more than usual. This is a good day to read, study, attend a class, or otherwise acquire new information. You may discover something new about a subject that really interests you, and you might want to spend the day reading about it.",Virgo
"Mar 2, 2022 - Today is a day to roll with the punches, Virgo. Don't take anything too seriously, and refrain from making any major decisions. You might get the sense that something or someone is working behind the scenes without your knowledge. Trust your instincts. See what you can do to bridge the gap between reality and what you sense from the spiritual world. Visit the ocean or take a long walk in the woods.",Virgo
"Mar 3, 2022 - Attempts to master a new computer program or other form of high-tech equipment could seem to be going nowhere, Virgo. You might tend to doubt your ability and thus feel very frustrated. However, keep at it. You aren't beyond all help! Nothing more than a little focus, concentration, and dogged persistence is required. It might also pay to ask someone's help who knows more about it.",Virgo
"Mar 4, 2022 - Today, Virgo, a subject that particularly interests you could cause you to delve into obscure sources to shed more light on it. Your intuition should help, but today you're more inclined to search for solid evidence. You might find what you seek in an unusual place and in an unconventional way. You might want to carry a notebook and pen with you today, even if it's just to the corner store!",Virgo
"Mar 5, 2022 - Enjoying the good times may be fun, but it may also get you into trouble down the road, Virgo. Be careful of spending all your resources on pleasure without setting something aside for leaner times. The company you keep could encourage your self-destructive behaviors. Since they know you'll always be in for a good time, you could get swept away by the energy of the crowd. Better to stick close to those who support healthier habits.",Virgo
"Mar 6, 2022 - Things should flow well for you today with very little effort on your part, Virgo. Take note that if any quarrel arises, it's an indication that the person you're arguing with isn't necessarily the right person to deal with or confide in. Emotional issues are likely to be the hardest ones to overcome, but this shouldn't be a problem for you. You have the ability to work through these like a pro.",Virgo
"Mar 7, 2022 - Remember that even though there is tension and chaos all around, Virgo, it doesn't have to affect you. Your motto should be you're ""in it but not of it."" The basis of most feuds boils down to the struggle between the old and the new. Try not to let their battles become yours. Learn from them by staying close enough to observe and understand but far enough away that you keep your hands clean.",Virgo
"Mar 8, 2022 - You're a born romantic by nature, Virgo, but today you're likely to think more in terms of physical passion than idealized romance. You're likely to be especially concerned with your appearance, and might want to go for a professional makeover or buy some new clothes. The color blue might seem especially appealing right now, but don't forget to add some red for passion! Phone your romantic interest and have fun tonight!",Virgo
"Mar 9, 2022 - Live your creative fantasies today, Virgo, but watch out for the reality police at the border. You may experience a bit of conflict with a stubborn person or in a situation that isn't very well planned. Think things through before taking action or else you may be lost in a world of daydreams without any escape route. Set your mind on the positive aspects of the situation and you'll succeed.",Virgo
"Mar 10, 2022 - There is a burning restlessness inside you that is activated because you don't feel as if you're fulfilling your life's destiny, Virgo. You could have a sudden insight that you have a much greater purpose in this life than what you're doing now. Explore this idea and see how you can move toward this desire that comes from deep within. This is the perfect time to put large, long-term plans into action.",Virgo
"Mar 11, 2022 - Anger is apt to stir inside you today, Virgo, so beware of any actions that might manifest as a result of this powerful feeling. Do what you can to find the deep source of this anger. If it's an obvious injustice, see the situation as an opportunity for change, and work to reform the policy that led to this breach of fairness and equality.",Virgo
"Mar 12, 2022 - Don't be a pushover today, Virgo. This is your time to lead. At least get your opinion out in the open and let it be known to the people around you. Put some passion in your day in order to liven things up and get the energy moving. A powerful transformation may take place within you as you start to wield your power instead of give it blindly away to others.",Virgo
"Mar 13, 2022 - Your faithful and diligent work, Virgo, in addition to a lot of sacrifices for the sake of your career, will soon bear fruit. The anticipation of a great evaluation, with possible advancement, is likely to have you walking on air all day, full of dreams and plans for the future. Enjoy this well-deserved peace of mind. Spend some time today enjoying your family. Perhaps you could plan a pre-celebration.",Virgo
"Mar 14, 2022 - You know that you have a very fertile imagination, Virgo, and today's aspects highlight this special quality. You might wish to channel your thoughts into an artistic endeavor like writing or painting. Be sure to grab any opportunity to weave a fascinating tale for a child. Be careful about letting your imagination run away with you when making judgments about people. They're most likely on the up and up.",Virgo
"Mar 15, 2022 - Strain within a group that you're associated with could be traced to money problems. Perhaps people are disagreeing over what needs to be done regarding fundraising or budgetary limitations. It's best to divorce yourself from this sort of thing if possible, Virgo. It's draining. Strange, vivid dreams might haunt your sleep tonight, but don't read too much into them. They aren't the kind with any special significance.",Virgo
"Mar 16, 2022 - Make the effort to get to a body of water today, Virgo. Whether it's the ocean, a river, or lake, the sense of expansion and comfort that you'll find there will be extremely healing. Know that you are the greatest healer you have for yourself and that you have incredible power to share this gift with others, too. Augment this healing energy with a return to nature.",Virgo
"Mar 17, 2022 - The completion of a long-term goal might have you feeling enthusiastic, energetic, and happy. You're also likely to be looking to the future, Virgo, formulating ideas for other projects and discussing them with friends. Group activities could benefit you at this time and put you in touch with new people who could possibly become close to you. In the evening, go to an exciting movie. A thriller would suit you just fine.",Virgo
"Mar 18, 2022 - Feel free to enlist your own creativity today to solve any problem that may come your way, Virgo. Don't feel like you absolutely need to take a rational and methodical approach. This sort of frame of mind has already been tried. Now it's time to explore a more intuitive way to complete any task that you wish to tackle now. Exercise more of your sensitive nature.",Virgo
"Mar 19, 2022 - Someone who lives far away, someone you haven't heard from for a long time, could give you a surprise phone call today. You'll be delighted and probably stay on the phone too long. You might need to run a few errands, but the weather could keep you indoors. Don't worry about it, Virgo. You'll still have time to take care of other pressing matters. You should be feeling especially artistic right now. Be creative!",Virgo
"Mar 20, 2022 - Today you could be faced with a bunch of people from out of town that you've never met before. You're likely to find this exciting and stimulating, but you could also feel a bit flustered. You might also not be at your most outgoing right now. This could be a better day to listen than to try to talk. Sometimes that impresses people more than anything you might say, Virgo.",Virgo
"Mar 21, 2022 - Today you might experience, however briefly, the most intense and refined type of spiritual love, Virgo. Perhaps this is for a friend, child, lover, or maybe for all life forms on the planet. You're also feeling especially artistic, so if you've been planning to make something as a gift, this is the time to do it. All signs bode well for other artistic projects as well. Go to it, and enjoy your day.",Virgo
"Mar 22, 2022 - You may have plans to get together with friends, and you're probably looking forward to it. However, Virgo, delays could get in the way, although you aren't likely to let them stop you. Your concentration and perseverance are both higher than usual, so it isn't likely that you'll give up on anything you start today. Therefore, this is a good day to either begin or continue projects that mean a lot to you.",Virgo
"Mar 23, 2022 - A young colleague could leave your place of employment under strange circumstances, Virgo, and this could come as a shock to you. You may have been quite fond of this person, and find yourself wondering about the truth behind the departure. Gossip may buzz, but don't pay any attention to it. Chances are it's a health problem, but no one, including your colleague, feels comfortable discussing it.",Virgo
"Mar 24, 2022 - Short trips in your neighborhood may be rendered nearly impossible today by factors above and beyond your control, such as traffic, construction, or both, Virgo. If you have errands to run, put them off. If you can, walk or ride a bicycle. If you must go in the car, however, make sure you have your favorite music with you so you can do something while waiting in traffic. Otherwise, you'll go crazy with boredom.",Virgo
"Mar 25, 2022 - Professional interests are definitely served by your intuition and fertile imagination today, Virgo. Writing, speaking, or the dramatic arts could be involved. If your career involves communication in any form, expect to capture the interest of a lot of people now. Positive career changes are in the wind, although they may not be apparent to you just yet. This isn't the time to worry about the future. For now, let your imagination guide you.",Virgo
"Mar 26, 2022 - You may feel at odds with the rest of the world now, Virgo, as you yearn for some quiet time alone. See if you can find a balance between spending time with your family and time alone. If you set the alarm to wake you early, you can enjoy the peace and quiet of dawn. If you aren't an early riser, you can always sequester yourself in the library for a few hours of solitude.",Virgo
"Mar 27, 2022 - If you're single and looking for love, Virgo, you may find it today in an ephemeral way. You could find yourself falling hard for the proverbial stranger across the crowded room. That might pose a problem if the room is actually a crowded subway, but faith is called for here. If the person appears to share your attraction, you'll manage to find each other. You have a lot to look forward to. Enjoy your day.",Virgo
"Mar 28, 2022 - As a person who enjoys being gregarious and outgoing, days like this provide a wonderful outlet for your energy. You might spend a lot of time with your family today, Virgo, but you'll also probably touch base with many others. At some point you might find yourself in the spotlight. You'll feel especially fond of everyone around you and appreciate your good fortune. Enjoy your day.",Virgo
"Mar 29, 2022 - Something wonderful could happen to you today at home, Virgo. A lover could declare eternal devotion, spiritual revelations could come thick and fast, or great news regarding career or money matters could be just over the horizon. Whatever comes is apt to bring happiness for all concerned. You may pinch yourself to make sure you're awake! Relax and enjoy it. You have it coming, and it's there to be savored.",Virgo
"Mar 30, 2022 - Financial worries could plague you today, Virgo. This is unfortunate, because your concerns are probably misplaced. There may be a few adjustments to make, but nothing a little belt-tightening for a few days can't fix. Find something inexpensive but fascinating to do like reading or watching a documentary. You'll forget your troubles and learn something in the meantime. Once you get past it, you should see it in proper perspective. Relax!",Virgo
"Mar 31, 2022 - Business might be going very well for you, Virgo, but intense changes on the job could have you feeling stressed. Delays in starting new projects could prove frustrating. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that this is going to be a trend. All should be brought back into focus tomorrow. Go to the gym tonight and work off some frustration. You'll be fresh in the morning. Hang in there!",Virgo
"Apr 1, 2022 - Today could be filled with unexpected twists, turns, and bends in the road that you may not be prepared for, Virgo. Apparently someone forgot to install the sign that warns of sharp curves ahead. Be on the lookout for unexpected forks in the road. When you get to them, take them, to coin a phrase. Your brain could receive a jolt from an outside source that reminds you to keep things real.",Virgo
"Apr 2, 2022 - You're likely to be feeling a bit lonely, perhaps even isolated, Virgo. Maybe you think no one else has your same wild thoughts running through their heads. You'd be surprised to learn how many people do. It's unlikely, however, that you'll share these thoughts with anyone, especially now. Don't feel like you have to. Just know that you aren't alone and that you have a network of support at all times.",Virgo
"Apr 3, 2022 - Aggression in your world of romance is likely, Virgo. Whether coming from you or your close partner, the tension is there and can't be ignored. Keep in mind, however, that it's possible that much of it stems from something that isn't even true. Perhaps there was a misspoken word or misunderstanding of some sort that's now causing confusion. Do your best to clear the air of any misconceptions.",Virgo
"Apr 4, 2022 - There is some likelihood of a slight career conflict, Virgo. You might have to deal with a co-worker who steps on your toes or runs roughshod over your gentle nature. Defend yourself with your favorite weapons - silence, laughter, and perspective. Let your adversary tangle himself or herself in desperate attempts to justify their behavior. Let your boss be the wise and discerning judge of the matter.",Virgo
"Apr 5, 2022 - More than ever before, you'll feel as though it's time to take matters into your own hands and build your own career future. You're fed up with living on hope and putting off your happiness until tomorrow. Your determination will be so strong that you could even surprise yourself. Tomorrow you'll refine your approach and make it more concrete. Today is the first day of a new life for you, Virgo.",Virgo
"Apr 6, 2022 - You tend to be very intuitive, Virgo, but today you could find your psychic abilities short-circuit. If you give readings, don't schedule any for today. This isn't to say your abilities are blocked, but they aren't as dependable as they usually are. Likewise, your imagination isn't as reliable either. Don't worry. This is just typical writer's or artist's block. You'll be back to normal by tomorrow.",Virgo
"Apr 7, 2022 - Some big upheaval in your career could take you by surprise, Virgo, but it's apt to make a very positive difference to you. Your public standing and income could both skyrocket. Legal papers might be involved in some way. This could happen so suddenly that it has you in a daze, but try to remain focused and go with the flow. You won't want this opportunity to pass you by.",Virgo
"Apr 8, 2022 - Your desire to see a romantic partner could be very strong today, Virgo. However, if you ask, you might be turned down. Don't jump to the conclusion that your friend doesn't want to see you. If he or she says there are responsibilities to attend to, believe it! You might have to wait until another day, but that's probably the worst that will happen. Have a little faith and hang in there!",Virgo
"Apr 9, 2022 - Virgo, you're likely to want to retreat into your bedroom and slam the door today. You won't feel like talking or socializing with anyone, not even those closest to you. Too much work could have you in a state of near exhaustion and almost total burnout, which means that getting some rest is probably the best thing you could do right now. Relax now, and get yourself going again tomorrow.",Virgo
"Apr 10, 2022 - A phone call or email from a friend could open up new career possibilities for you, Virgo, perhaps involving the communications industry. Tales of people who have hit it big in this field could be circulating widely, but you should carefully consider all the aspects of any new option before jumping in. You don't want to have any regrets about your decision later. Think about it!",Virgo
"Apr 11, 2022 - Are you contemplating a move of some kind, Virgo? Perhaps you're thinking about relocating to be closer to members of a group with which you're affiliated. You might also be considering a move to a community where spiritual and metaphysical values are not only discussed but also lived. Make a list of your options, if that helps. You're in a transitional period right now. You need to be practical.",Virgo
"Apr 12, 2022 - Today's planetary aspects indicate that this is likely to be a day of excess, Virgo, some of it good, some of it not so good. Take care not to overindulge in food and drink. You could be merely acting out your stress with such behavior. You'd be better served to meditate and get to the root of the problem. On the other hand, money could come your way, possibly a lot of it!",Virgo
"Apr 13, 2022 - An intense study of philosophy, religion, or some other exalted school of thought could find you involved with a group that shares your interest in the subject. You could make a new friend today, or if you aren't currently romantically involved, meet a potential romantic partner. This should be a very satisfying day on both mental and emotional levels. Remember how it all came about, and enjoy yourself!",Virgo
"Apr 14, 2022 - Today could have you itching for a change, Virgo. The difficulty is figuring out what you really want to do with your life. A good first step would be to talk to people. Find out what they do and don't like about their careers. Use the library and the Internet. Take a profile test, such as Myers-Briggs, to see what types of careers mesh with your personality. Once you've done this, you're bound to have a clearer vision of where you want to go.",Virgo
"Apr 15, 2022 - You'll want to respond to your creative juices, which will be flowing freely today, Virgo. Don't suppress the urge to sing, compose, paint, or write. You'll be in the full flower of creativity, so make the most of it. You'll be able to take care of your daily obligations and still make room for your creative expression. Listen to the messages you receive in your heart and let them burst forth.",Virgo
"Apr 16, 2022 - This could be a rather intense day for you, Virgo. Your mind is filled with plots for novels you want to write and ideas for ways to streamline production at work. Don't you have an ""pause"" switch? You'd benefit from taking some much-needed time off. You'll find that you can quiet your mind simply by sipping some tea and being still for ten minutes. Call it meditation or a break, but allow yourself this small indulgence.",Virgo
"Apr 17, 2022 - This is bound to be a wonderful day, Virgo, as everybody seems to be in a warm and congenial mood. You and your romantic partner, in particular, are feeling especially close and connected today. If marriage is the process of falling in and out of love, then you're both definitely in the ""in"" phase. Enjoy it while it lasts! Spend a quiet day together and cap it off with dinner at an elegant bistro.",Virgo
"Apr 18, 2022 - This is going to be a rather busy day for you, Virgo, and you're likely to love every minute of it. You can expect to meet many people as you go about your day. There will be side trips and detours that you weren't anticipating, but they're all the more delightful because of their spontaneity, like the unexpected lunch with a friend. Such stolen moments enrich your life.",Virgo
"Apr 19, 2022 - Making decisions today is apt to be nearly impossible for you, Virgo. That's why you should leave them up to someone else. Walk with your partner so you don't have to really think about where you're going. Your job is to focus on the emotional side of things and make it safe for everyone to dream. Your loving, caring nature is a valuable commodity these days. Protect and cherish this gift.",Virgo
"Apr 20, 2022 - Your natural psychic or intuitive abilities could be short-circuited today, Virgo. Interference from the minds of other people could cloud issues, and this won't do you any good. Your imaginative faculties could be rather garbled as well. The best possible advice would be to take the day for your own needs. You can go back to your usual routine tomorrow.",Virgo
"Apr 21, 2022 - If you play your cards right, Virgo, you just might be able to turn what you're picking up psychically into an exalted creative effort. The emotions and images flowing into your brain might be obscure, but they're significant in some way. Whether you write, play music, dance, or paint, you could be blown away by your own work. Whatever your materials, get them out and memorialize your inspiration. Tomorrow you'll be glad you did!",Virgo
"Apr 22, 2022 - Someone at your workplace could suddenly find you very attractive and make no secret of it today, Virgo. How you respond, of course, is up to you, but if you don't reciprocate this person's feelings, don't respond positively simply because you're flattered. This could cause trouble for you down the line, particularly if this person is in a position of authority. Hold out for the right person!",Virgo
"Apr 23, 2022 - You feel invincible, Virgo, as though you can do anything. Enjoy this abundance of energy, for it's certainly unusual. Take care not to overdo it. If you haven't jogged in a while, running five miles today will leave you pretty sore tomorrow. Similarly, don't try to finish all your household repairs in one day. Remember that slow and easy wins the race and keeps you in shape for the long haul!",Virgo
"Apr 24, 2022 - If you feel like you're trying to push a square peg into a round hole, you're probably right, Virgo. Whether you're having personal or professional difficulties, there are times when it just doesn't pay to try so hard. In fact, it's often a sign that there is something fundamentally wrong with the relationship. Try to take more of a philosophical attitude, Virgo. If it's meant to work, it will.",Virgo
"Apr 25, 2022 - If you often help people in need, or if helping people is part of your profession, this day will bring certain ideas to light, Virgo. You need to take the time on a regular basis to take care of yourself. If you don't, you won't be able to continue to help others. Think about it and stop making excuses for why you can't do it. Think of yourself for a change.",Virgo
"Apr 26, 2022 - Today is full of possibilities, Virgo. You could fall in love at first sight, or at least meet someone who captures your interest! You should be feeling especially loving, passionate, and eager to devote yourself to a worthy cause or creative activity. Don't expect everything to fall into place right away. You could hit a few obstacles, but the ultimate result will be worth the bumps along the way.",Virgo
"Apr 27, 2022 - Today doubts may crop up for you concerning certain spiritual concepts that you've embraced for a long time, Virgo. Don't let this cause a crisis. It could just be a normal part of your inner growth. Instead, go back and read the old books that got you started, and then read some new ones and try to view the ideas from your current perspective. You could find they aren't so doubtful after all.",Virgo
"Apr 28, 2022 - A female visitor could come to your door today with some interesting, useful information, Virgo. It might involve anything from stock market trends to a forthcoming wedding to occult and metaphysical matters. Whatever it is, you'll find it captivating, and might just sit and listen to your guest for quite a while. By the time she leaves, your mind may well be spinning. Take a walk to clear your head or you'll be awake all night.",Virgo
"Apr 29, 2022 - Today you might read a book on exercise or nutrition that seems a bit unsettling, Virgo. According to the book, you're doing everything wrong! Remember that what the author is probably outlining is a certain practice that worked for him or her. Everyone is different. Don't change your habits for practices that don't feel right. Consult a professional if you're still concerned. Such a person is more than capable of discerning what's right for you.",Virgo
"Apr 30, 2022 - Although you might find the day ahead somewhat stressful, it's a key day in your professional evolution. Since you've lacked inspiration lately, you must not miss the opportunity you'll be presented with today. You could find out about an internship in a new field, which may lead to a new passion or commitment. Expect to see a new wish for the future forming within you, Virgo!",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"May 1, 2022 - Today is no time for dreaming, Virgo! Quite the contrary. You can expect to have to settle a number of minor technical problems involving communications or transmissions. On the whole, it will be a somewhat trying day, but at least your mind will be occupied, leaving no room for the difficult internal questions that have been bothering you so much lately.",Virgo
"May 2, 2022 - Perhaps you're stuck in a mindset you can't seem to escape, Virgo. Be careful about taking action based on ideas rooted more in past fantasy than present reality. Your emotions could be playing tricks on you. You could be attached to a dream that has more to do with feeding your ego than fulfilling your destiny. Question your motives. You might find that you're better off redirecting your energy somewhere else.",Virgo
"May 3, 2022 - Your natural compassion may have led you to choose a profession in which healing or helping other people is your primary duty. Even if this isn't the case, Virgo, the people around you may seem particularly demanding today. But be careful not to go beyond your personal limits or else you could be the one who needs other people's help!",Virgo
"May 4, 2022 - Some rather depressing information could come your way, Virgo, but don't take it at face value. It might not be as bad as it seems. Check the facts before making yourself crazy. This isn't a good day for visiting or running errands in your neighborhood, as the traffic could be a nightmare. Anything you try to read today could seem boring, so movies are likely to be the best entertainment now.",Virgo
"May 5, 2022 - Spiritual and intellectual matters may be very much on your mind, Virgo. A lot of ideas could have come your way, although until now they may not have been very focused. Today, however, your mind should be clear enough to write down your thoughts and read the works of others in order to gain more insight. The possibility of a short trip out of town could also arise. Enjoy your day.",Virgo
"May 6, 2022 - Your indecisiveness may plague you, Virgo. This is one of those times when you feel as if one second of hesitation will cost you dearly. Yet you take a while to process and internalize things before you're ready to act on them. Others may act and speak before they think. Don't get upset at yourself for handling things the way you do. More than anything, it's your lack of self-confidence that's holding you back.",Virgo
"May 7, 2022 - Do what you can to stabilize your emotions, Virgo. Romance should be on a slow, steady path as long as you're honest with yourself and others about how you feel. Perhaps you're so caught up in your fantasy world that you fail to see that things are actually moving in your favor. Conflict that arises today may be uncomfortable, but ultimately it will shed more light on the truth of the situation.",Virgo
"May 8, 2022 - Today will be fairly calm in terms of outside events, but your inner world is likely to be in a rush of activity. Today you wish you could find the solution to your heartaches as well as your career predicaments. You'd like to achieve some supreme understanding of the events that took place over the past month. First you must force your brain to slow down. Haste makes waste, as you know!",Virgo
"May 9, 2022 - Until now, you didn't know you were capable of managing people with problems. But the so-called poetic universe you inhabit is actually much more realistic than it seems at first glance. People who believe that human reality is 100 percent logical will feel ridiculous when they see the elegant, humane solutions you invent.",Virgo
"May 10, 2022 - Your stroll through the universe of possibilities that you so love has come to an end, Virgo. It's time for you to come back to Earth and join the rest of us. You have more hope than most people, like the good Virgo that you are. You understand that we need your imagination and courage regarding the future! Today you may have to make an important professional decision.",Virgo
"May 11, 2022 - You can expect today to be kind of intense, Virgo. Even if you've made a conscious decision not to let anything get you down, you may still harbor some negative emotions from the last few days. Take advantage of this time to relieve stress. Talk to someone close or go out and whack a tennis ball. An artistic pursuit, such as sketching or photography, will help eliminate some of the negative energy.",Virgo
"May 12, 2022 - Getting out and working with groups could seem especially appealing today, particularly groups involving athletics or other physical activities. This is an excellent day to go out for team sports or attend a yoga, aerobics, or tai chi class. You could also want to make a short trip out of town with some friends. A bit of adventure is definitely in the wind for you, Virgo. Enjoy it!",Virgo
"May 13, 2022 - Feeling unusually adventurous, Virgo? You're often motivated by your idealistic expectations, and the planetary configurations today are going to push you even further on your spiritual quest. Satisfy your desire to discover new horizons and meet new people by saying hello to anyone and everyone you feel like talking to. Sometimes life's biggest adventures begin with a simple action.",Virgo
"May 14, 2022 - Today's aspects are suggesting that you take a good hard look at the state of your ego, Virgo. Are you too proud or too humble? Buddhists say that the path to spiritual fulfillment lies in knowing how to build a healthy ego while at the same time developing a part of oneself completely foreign to the ego. Are you working hard at this?",Virgo
"May 15, 2022 - More than ever before, you'll feel as though it's time to take matters into your own hands and build your future, Virgo. You're fed up with living on hope and putting your happiness off until tomorrow. Your determination will be so strong that you may even surprise yourself. You'll refine your approach and make it more concrete in the coming days. Today is the first day of a new life for you.",Virgo
"May 16, 2022 - This is an excellent day for you, Virgo. You should find that things are running smoothly and to your advantage. Watch out for those who may want to rain on your parade by bombarding you with information that doesn't really connect with the way you feel. This information is unrelated to the real issues - how you feel and why. Pay attention to your heart.",Virgo
"May 17, 2022 - You can interpret the day ahead as an open-ended question about you, Virgo. You may have noticed certain physical or psychological aspects of yourself that make you uncomfortable. The day ahead may force you to take action to correct that attitude. If you just share your concerns with a friend or relative, you'll accomplish a great deal.",Virgo
"May 18, 2022 - Was someone close to you rude without any provocation? Were you the target of unpleasant criticism? You take these slights to heart. Beginning today, and throughout the days to come, you can expect to withdraw somewhat in order to lick your wounds. You need more harmony and gentleness in your love life, and you're likely to obtain that soon. Be patient!",Virgo
"May 19, 2022 - Decisions will be even more difficult to make than usual today, Virgo. On the one hand, you may feel a need to stabilize, while on the other hand find that your energy is raging in a million different directions as you want to seek new experiences and social interactions with others. Try to adopt a plan that combines both of these energies. Nervous energy will keep you moving.",Virgo
"May 20, 2022 - Consciously, realize that you're someone unique and special, Virgo. Remember this through the day and let your actions reflect this affirmation. There's a rather distinct intensity to the day that might cause others to be on edge. Don't be disrupted if there are people freaking out in your world. The good news is that you should be able to handle this intense blast of emotion easily. Emotions are your forte!",Virgo
"May 21, 2022 - There's an excellent day on the horizon, Virgo. If you feel hemmed in by fears or uncertainties in your love life, the day ahead will give you the courage to discuss these matters with your mate. Even if more time is necessary to settle things completely, you should make good use of today's clear communication channels. You won't be disappointed (and neither will your mate).",Virgo
"May 22, 2022 - Other people might have a hard time navigating through the day, thanks to the intensity and corruption that's likely to surface. You have nothing to worry about, Virgo, because your adaptable nature is perfectly suited to dealing with the stubborn forces that are likely to rear their heads. This is a good time to clean out your closet and throw away things you no longer need. Be ruthless.",Virgo
"May 23, 2022 - Take a look at what's going on around you today, Virgo. Do some internal processing before you reach a conclusion about the best way to proceed. You may find that powerful forces are trying to win you over to one camp or another. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of doing things. Keep in mind that the best route is often a combination of several different paths.",Virgo
"May 24, 2022 - This would be a good day for you to sort out your business, Virgo. You should file important papers and get rid of extraneous materials or trivia at work. Taking the time to do this will save you even more time in the long run. As for your love life, be expressive. Clear up any old misunderstandings that could interfere with your pleasure. Above all, enjoy yourself!",Virgo
"May 25, 2022 - Feel free to take the lazy route today, Virgo. Don't lift a finger if you don't really have to. It may be hard to get others moving as well. You can prod all you want, but, ultimately, if people don't want to go, they aren't going to. Your flexible nature might be put to the test. More than likely, you'll find that you need to adapt to the whims of others rather than the other way around.",Virgo
"May 26, 2022 - Shake off the dust of the past few weeks and put the confusion behind you, Virgo. Your tremendous imagination and creative ability have been dormant lately because you may have not known how best to channel them. Perhaps they've been used negatively, leading to fallout in certain areas of your life. The good news is that things are changing. You should make a conscious effort to refocus this creativity in a positive direction.",Virgo
"May 27, 2022 - Your intuitive nature is especially strong, Virgo. You won't have to think about things because you'll have the ability to just know the answers. If any penetrating detective work needs to be done, this would be an excellent time to do it. Your caring, sensitive nature will get you through any door you want to walk through today. Keep that smile on your face at all times.",Virgo
"May 28, 2022 - To understand the major shift that's taking place, Virgo, you must look at events from a lofty perspective. A slow-acting liberation is gathering momentum. In the next seven months, you'll be unable to resist the opportunity to rid yourself of some oppressive part of your past. You'll shed your old complexes and emerge renewed. Don't be alarmed if some family relations suffer as a result. The distress is only temporary.",Virgo
"May 29, 2022 - Frolic in a wide-open field today, Virgo. Pick some wildflowers and put them in a vase on your kitchen table. If you can't leave the house or go beyond the back yard, do something equivalent to frolicking and picking. Small things can bring sunshine and hope to a stagnant situation. Clear your mind of unnecessary clutter and open it to new possibilities. Nature remains your best friend, coronavirus notwithstanding.",Virgo
"May 30, 2022 - This is your day, Virgo. You may find that people gravitate to you for advice and support. They're apt to lower their guard and more openly accept things you believe in. Conversations could lead to more spiritual topics, and before you know it, you'll be giving lessons on the meaning of life. Suddenly, your private thoughts are reaching a huge audience that's eager for your words. Use this power responsibly.",Virgo
"May 31, 2022 - Don't be surprised if things don't go exactly according to plan today, Virgo. Unexpected events are likely to pop up and disturb the course of action. Realize that these disruptions have a place in your life and that they're occurring for a reason. You might not understand exactly how or why, but that's OK. You don't need to know. Welcome these new energies into your life.",Virgo
"Jun 1, 2022 - Some absolutely wonderful news could come your way, Virgo, possibly about career or financial success, perhaps involving positive changes in your neighborhood. If you've been thinking about working in writing or publishing - or any art, for that matter - this is the day to set events in motion. Your imagination is operating at a high level and so is your ability to communicate with others. Go for it.",Virgo
"Jun 2, 2022 - You're normally intuitive, Virgo, but today you might feel more psychic than you ever dreamed you could. Information received from the media could have you picking up psychically on the thoughts and feelings of people you've never met. This can be emotionally overpowering, so protect yourself by keeping the white light around you. Channel your thoughts and feelings into art of some kind. It helps.",Virgo
"Jun 3, 2022 - A small financial windfall might have you in a bit of a quandary about how to spend it, Virgo. You could have a bill you particularly want to pay, but you might also want to treat yourself to a minor luxury of some kind. The best option now might be to indulge yourself a little. You've been working hard, and unless you're behind on your bills, you deserve a little treat. Go for it.",Virgo
"Jun 4, 2022 - Stress could take a toll on you today, Virgo. You might temporarily lose your ambition and be left wondering if it's all really worth it. This isn't a good day to start projects or engage in important discussions. Stay home and get some rest if you can. You might skip a few chores, but you'll be better off in the long run. Treat yourself to a good book and some ice cream.",Virgo
"Jun 5, 2022 - Romance intensifies as communication is enhanced by the energy, enthusiasm, and focus of you and your partner, Virgo. If you aren't already involved, you might find out about someone new and exciting who shares your interests, and perhaps doesn't live all that far away. Expect to make a lot of short trips in your neighborhood, perhaps to check out new things you’ve heard about. If you've been thinking of moving, you might do a little house hunting.",Virgo
"Jun 6, 2022 - Expect to hear some great news from relatives or neighbors, perhaps involving money. You could hear this from more than one source, Virgo, so it's likely true. You might spend a lot of time driving around, mainly running errands but also seeking people who are in the know. Someone you need to reach won't be available, but don't let that stop you. Continue and you'll find what you want.",Virgo
"Jun 7, 2022 - Virgo, your working life and income are likely to be enhanced today through the influence of people who live in distant states or foreign countries. The desire for knowledge is probably strong, and you might seek to develop some new skills. Your romantic life is also likely to be thriving since you feel passionate and project that feeling to others. Expect some surprises from a current or potential romantic partner.",Virgo
"Jun 8, 2022 - You'll be the savior of the day. Your wisdom and patience will be your best assets today, Virgo. You'll be of great help to those around you. You'll counsel them and be able to guide them toward better days. All those who are lost in their personal problems just need someone like you. You're their friend and they appreciate your generosity.",Virgo
"Jun 9, 2022 - You need to cut down on stress and stop getting upset over nothing, Virgo. Even if up until now you haven't been able to figure out what is really bothering you, today you'll understand some of the mysteries of your personality, and understand what it is exactly that causes those chronic mood swings of yours. You'll see that you have nothing to worry about.",Virgo
"Jun 10, 2022 - You may feel annoyed about the attitude of some of your group of friends. Unlike these people, you're very open-minded and you can deal with situations as they arise. Indeed, you have a natural ability to adapt to every situation. Virgo, today you'll probably have to arbitrate between two people with widely differing opinions.",Virgo
"Jun 11, 2022 - Relationships with those closest to you, particularly friends and love partners, should be enhanced by an increased understanding of their emotional world, Virgo. You're likely to identify even more strongly than usual with others' feelings, and this could provide inspiration for artistic activities of some kind. This is also a great day to have deep, philosophical conversations with your friends. Consider the wide range of topics you have to discuss.",Virgo
"Jun 12, 2022 - Today a strong sense of destiny could lead you to someone new - either a potential close friend or prospective romantic partner. You're apt to feel especially protective toward this person, Virgo, and even though he or she is new to you. You could feel as if you've known this person forever. Artistic activities benefit from increased intuition and physical and mental energy. Expect to shine! Enjoy your day.",Virgo
"Jun 13, 2022 - Today you'll have the strange feeling that something is floating in the air. The time is right to try to understand the different needs of your family circle. There will be a lot of movement around you, Virgo, so you should feel free to step back. Your relatives will understand that you need more space in order to gain perspective on the situation.",Virgo
"Jun 14, 2022 - You've felt the need to create over the past several days, Virgo. This attitude is certainly due to the planetary positions, but it could also underlie your desire to change your professional and private lives. Therefore, you should let your creative mind come out. How about writing poetry or enrolling in a ceramics class? Don't refrain from showing this secret part of your personality to those closest to you.",Virgo
"Jun 15, 2022 - Communicating with a current or potential romantic partner could involve a lot of subtlety, finding a way to enjoy each other's company while not divulging too much. You're likely to feel especially passionate today, Virgo. Take care of your health and look your best. Your aesthetic sense is especially high right now. You could also give some thought to artistic projects. Inspiration could be all around you.",Virgo
"Jun 16, 2022 - Contemplation is the word for today. At some point, you might receive a call from a friend wanting advice on a serious decision. Don't be surprised if you spend more time listening than advising, Virgo. Goals of your own might need some thought and possibly reevaluation, as changes in your immediate environment could present new and exciting possibilities to you. Think about it.",Virgo
"Jun 17, 2022 - Virgo, you are worried that some of the people close to your heart might change. You have been watching and paying attention to subtle signs and changes for quite some time now. Today you will feel like a guide, and you will help those who might need you. You will be able to show them the way and help them to fulfill their needs.",Virgo
"Jun 18, 2022 - As the real Virgo that you are, you aren't in the habit of talking without saying anything constructive. Sometimes people accuse you of having nothing to say. When you're just being patient, they say that you're ignorant. When you're demonstrating your tolerance, they say you're indifferent. Today it's time for those people to learn the real truth about you and understand just how much you have to say about the world.",Virgo
"Jun 19, 2022 - Your altruism and ability to listen to others will greatly influence the day, Virgo. Someone close to you is having difficulties and doesn't know how to explain the problem. This person needs you and knows that you're the only one who can help find a way out. Make time to listen patiently and you'll find a solution together.",Virgo
"Jun 20, 2022 - Perhaps you were able to see friends or neighbors a day or so ago, Virgo, but today you don't feel like socializing. Nerve strain and other stresses might leave you more in the mood to be alone. However, since your friends could be connected with your business, you won't want to shut them out. The best thing to do is stay in close communication with them. Accomplish what you want as quickly as possible.",Virgo
"Jun 21, 2022 - There is no need to frown when another person walks by just because you don't know that person, Virgo. You must break the habit of living your life in fear. Take active steps toward curing this trend by not stepping down when strong forces try to intimidate you with brute strength. Promote the picture of peace and serenity that you have inside your head. Bring out more of your inner self.",Virgo
"Jun 22, 2022 - There's a loving tenderness in the air that you'll find very comforting, Virgo. Ground your sensitive emotions and make room for love to enter the picture. It could be that you're feeling indecisive when it comes to matters of love and romance. The best thing for you to do is stabilize your emotions and then make the effort to connect intimately with another. The decisions will flow naturally from there.",Virgo
"Jun 23, 2022 - The fog has lifted and you're ready to take off, Virgo. The dreaminess you may have experienced lately has been nice, but now it's time to get moving again. Use all that you have learned from that recent internal processing and put it to use in the practical world. Try not to get caught up in the crossfire of conversations that don't really pertain to you. Feel free to start something new.",Virgo
"Jun 24, 2022 - Today may prove to be one of your busiest in a long time, Virgo. The promise of continuing success could find you spending a lot of time on the phone, sending faxes or emails, or perhaps making a few short trips around the community. You might not be able to reach everyone you hoped to speak to, however. Don't let this get you down. Just be persistent and you'll reach them eventually.",Virgo
"Jun 25, 2022 - Paperwork, perhaps contracts or other legal documents of some kind, might need attention so you can move ahead with some of your projects. These projects could involve writing or speaking. Your mind is in just the right space to participate in anything involving communication, Virgo, and doors of opportunity may open up for you in this field. Gird your loins and get to it. You'll be glad you did.",Virgo
"Jun 26, 2022 - Someone close to you might seem more preoccupied than usual, Virgo, and perhaps a bit difficult to deal with. Don't take this personally. It has little if anything to do with you. He or she doesn't want to share their troubles. You might be feeling a bit tense and jumpy, but this is nothing to worry about. Take a brisk walk or work out. This should bring some relief.",Virgo
"Jun 27, 2022 - Romance is coming your way today as long as you stay levelheaded about the immediate situation, Virgo. Take care of menial daily tasks and then let your heart soar. You'll find that you have a strong connection to your emotions. Trust your instincts and feel free to let your heart take control. Be realistic about your relationships with others but push the boundaries once they've been set.",Virgo
"Jun 28, 2022 - A higher level of intuition and inspiration than is usual for you could enhance your artistic talents, Virgo. A powerful drive to express the stories, pictures, or music that may be flooding your mind could result in your spending as much of the day as possible in seclusion, jotting down thoughts and ideas. By day's end, you might have spent most of your free time alone yet be very satisfied with the results.",Virgo
"Jun 29, 2022 - Get your head out of the clouds today, Virgo, and come back to Earth for just a little bit. There are some things you need to take care of here. Mundane tasks and routine jobs won't be painful after you set your mind to getting them done. You'll be able to accomplish quite a bit. Just make sure to keep a level head about the reality of the situation.",Virgo
"Jun 30, 2022 - You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Virgo. The old ways of doing things are in conflict with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and sleight of hand. Also, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best solution. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"Jul 1, 2022 - You might experience a great deal of emotional confusion today, Virgo. There's a debate brewing inside you. You're having a hard time deciding whether to pursue the practical or the fanciful. Looking to others for help could only add to the confusion, so take their advice with a grain of salt. If nothing seems clear to you, then wait it out and proceed when you have a better handle on things.",Virgo
"Jul 2, 2022 - Today is a great day to go out and get things done, Virgo. You might find that you're a bit indecisive, but don't sweat it. Don't feel like you have to make any great commitments. You'll do fine jumping around from lily pad to lily pad. Get yourself into the open and express what's on your mind. Engage in some sort of physical activity that gets your circulation going.",Virgo
"Jul 3, 2022 - Your emotions may be a bit erratic. It could be hard for you to focus on anything today, Virgo. Things continue to shift from one topic to the next with little resolution of any. Others aren't apt to be very sympathetic to your feelings, so don't expect them to be. You'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment. It's a better day to focus on your head rather than your heart.",Virgo
"Jul 4, 2022 - Stop trying to feel everyone else's emotions and really feel your own, Virgo. Being empathetic to others' needs is charitable, but you need to face the music and look at yourself. Make a clear distinction between your needs and those of others. Express your feelings to those around you. Ask for help if you need it. Other people aren't mind readers. They probably have no idea what you feel.",Virgo
"Jul 5, 2022 - Reach for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, Virgo. It's closer than you think. Indeed, your dreams are completely within your reach, and there are huge forces at work helping you achieve your goals. You should find yourself in a favorable mood all day. People will be more sensitive than usual to your emotions. Let your fantasies lead the way.",Virgo
"Jul 6, 2022 - Feel free to speak up today, Virgo. Perhaps no one has heard your point of view in a while. It's probably important for them to hear it. Just because people don't ask for your opinion, that doesn't mean it isn't valid. You have incredible intuitive insight that others fail to see. Don't assume they know what you're thinking - even though you probably know what they're thinking.",Virgo
"Jul 7, 2022 - You might find yourself a bit unfocused and confused about which way to go, Virgo. The baffled look on your face isn't helping anyone else figure out how to help you. Don't feel obliged to remain in an unhealthy situation. It may be time to let go and break some ties to things that no longer work for you. Feel good about extricating yourself from old habits that no longer serve you.",Virgo
"Jul 8, 2022 - Get your head out of the clouds, Virgo. You'll find out that nitpicky details you failed to attend to earlier are now coming back to haunt you. Don't postpone your work any further. The time to take care of the job is now. Balance your checkbook and do your laundry. Clean your bathtub and go grocery shopping. The more you accomplish today, the better you'll feel about yourself tomorrow.",Virgo
"Jul 9, 2022 - Try to have a positive, optimistic outlook today, Virgo. Adopt an attitude of gratitude and look to see the beauty in everything around you. This is a day to appreciate what you've got, especially the people who love you. Compliment others and let them know how much they mean to you. These words and deeds will have a rippling effect that will bring you a great deal of good fortune.",Virgo
"Jul 10, 2022 - Some intense dreams could visit you tonight. Keep a notebook and pen by your bedside, Virgo. It's important you remember them. You'll want to visualize every single detail. In the morning, you might want to reflect on their possible meaning. They could give rise to new knowledge about yourself, a new spiritual revelation, or artistic inspiration. Books could be of particular assistance in understanding what your dreams are telling you.",Virgo
"Jul 11, 2022 - People are apt to be quite emotional when it comes to the appearance they wish to project today, Virgo, so be careful where you step. It's your job to see through the trendy makeup and fashion that hide the true personalities of the people who insist on wearing these masks. The key is not to be fooled by those who hide behind a facade built more by society than by themselves.",Virgo
"Jul 12, 2022 - It's time to implement the plans you fostered as a result of internal processes over the past few days, Virgo. Hop in the driver's seat and take control. As you do, you may need to erect a bit of a mental barrier. People could be somewhat abrasive, and your sensitive nature is susceptible to harsh comments. Take things with a grain of salt. Remember that if people criticize you, it's because they love you.",Virgo
"Jul 13, 2022 - Your intuition is operating at a very high level today, Virgo. You tend to follow your heart by nature, so you don't always go out of your way to be logical or objective. However, more than one event could occur during the day in which it's imperative that you go with your intuition even though it defies all logic. Have a little faith and go with your gut!",Virgo
"Jul 14, 2022 - A small sum of money could come your way today, Virgo. It could be that someone pays you what's owed you, or you could win a small amount in a lottery. You might find a $20 bill lying in the street! Sex and romance are very much on your mind. If you can't get together with a partner this evening, you might curl up with a steamy novel or watch a romantic video.",Virgo
"Jul 15, 2022 - Romance and marriage are very much on your mind today, Virgo. A special conversation with a possible love partner could have you hankering for happily ever after. Books on attracting and maintaining relationships might be especially appealing as well as useful. Take care not to put too much stock in detailed analyses, however. Remember that such books are based on generalities. You're unique.",Virgo
"Jul 16, 2022 - You'll probably be perfectly in tune with the day ahead, Virgo. Of course, there are days when it's tempting to run away from the reality of the moment and its hardships. At times like today, you're so compassionate that you find it easy to listen to others, and life is truly rewarding. People find your company soothing and pleasant, and they are likely to thank you for it.",Virgo
"Jul 17, 2022 - You tend to be rather intuitive, Virgo, but today your psychic abilities could seem more focused than usual. You're better able to tune in to thoughts, feelings, and events. If you give readings, this is a good day for it, because you're apt to be more accurate than usual. Don't do too many or you could lose your focus and not do anyone else any good. Work steadily and pace yourself.",Virgo
"Jul 18, 2022 - You might wake up this morning, look in the mirror, and decide that you hate what you see even though you probably look fine. This is a good day to shop for new clothes or get a haircut. Perhaps you feel a little blue. Getting out and indulging yourself is more a necessity than luxury. Don't overindulge in food or drink now, Virgo. You might not like the consequences tomorrow!",Virgo
"Jul 19, 2022 - Your romantic, sensitive nature comes alive today, Virgo, and you may find yourself searching for the security of a close lover. You're apt to be pickier than usual - not just anyone will do anymore. There is a longing within you for the company of someone who shares your deep intuitive understanding of people, emotions, and life in general. Don't settle for anything less.",Virgo
"Jul 20, 2022 - As a natural healer, you might find yourself experiencing a rush of transformative energy today, which you should put into practice. This is a great time to go for a massage or study natural healing modalities such as herbs or aromatherapy. Combine them with your innate healing abilities, Virgo, and you might be happy with the results. Your mind is especially receptive right now. You'll retain more of what you learn than you usually would.",Virgo
"Jul 21, 2022 - Other people are likely to be anxious to get up and moving with their plans, Virgo. It might be better for you to hang back a bit and see how things pan out before you take action. Let others go across the river first to learn the best way. Do you take a boat, wade, or look for a bridge? Let someone else be the guinea pig so you'll have all the information you need to make the most prudent decision on how to proceed.",Virgo
"Jul 22, 2022 - Going with the flow may not necessarily appeal to you today, Virgo. This is one time when you may want to be the fish swimming upstream while the school heads downstream. Feel free to go your own way regardless of what others have to say about it. You may get pressured by your loved ones to act a certain way or go somewhere special. Don't do these things just to please them. Do what pleases you.",Virgo
"Jul 23, 2022 - It's obvious how much you like to dream, Virgo. Certainly, this is an important part of your existence. Realize that there comes a time when you must face reality. This is one of those days when you need to bite the bullet and deal with your bills. Take care of annoying errands that you've been putting off. Send the letters that have piled up on your desk for days. Stop making excuses.",Virgo
"Jul 24, 2022 - It's time to finally apply the knowledge you've accumulated and come to recognize the truth, Virgo. Perhaps you've been sitting on the facts while contemplating their meaning. It's now time to get this information out into the open. There's no doubt that this action is likely to make waves, but that's OK. A key theme of the day is transformation, so feel free to contribute your part.",Virgo
"Jul 25, 2022 - You may be feeling a little bit lost in the dust today, Virgo. Somehow what you're thinking and feeling isn't exactly coordinating with the current conversation. Don't think you need to agree with the group just to feel like you fit in. Maintaining your own point of view is critical. You're better off rolling with the punches rather than trying to put up a fight.",Virgo
"Jul 26, 2022 - There may be a great deal of charge in your battery today, Virgo, but you could be unsure about where to put all this energy. Get up and do some exercise. Give your body the workout it needs. Remember what it's like to sweat. You'll feel much better about yourself afterward, and you'll be much more likely to continue on a healthy path if you push your body to its limits.",Virgo
"Jul 27, 2022 - You may need to adjust today in order to relate well to people and situations, Virgo. Things are a bit off kilter, and you may find that the harder you try to fit in, the more liable you are to feel like an oddball. Try not to get caught up in others' battles. Maintain a balance between real life and fantasy. Don't get so caught up in someone else's world that you forget to deal with your own.",Virgo
"Jul 28, 2022 - One of the important lessons of the day for you is to remember that emotions are powerful things to recognize and honor. Don't discount your feelings. In fact, it's most important that you embrace them with your whole being. Once you relax and settle into your true emotions, you'll find that your mind clears and you can make conscious, rational decisions about whatever issues come your way.",Virgo
"Jul 29, 2022 - You could learn a tough lesson today, Virgo. More than likely, the harder the message hits you, the more important it was for you to hear. It's important that you accept failure gracefully. It could be that the one who kicks you when you're down will also be the one who helps you get up. There are strange twists to this day that you may not expect. Take things in stride.",Virgo
"Jul 30, 2022 - This isn't the most cheerful time, Virgo, because important issues are rearing their heads again and forcing you to address them. You'd rather not, but you can't wish them away. The time has come to deal with them once and for all. It's especially important that you make an effort to make your home life more positive and upbeat. Your loved ones look to you to set the tone.",Virgo
"Jul 31, 2022 - There's tension in the air today, Virgo. Even though it isn't your doing, you may want to keep a low profile, especially if you need to work. Try to avoid any discussions. Just because someone is confrontational doesn't mean you have to rise to the bait. It would be better if you didn't. Keep to yourself and all of this will blow over by tomorrow when it will be safe to mingle again.",Virgo
"Aug 1, 2022 - Today is a fantastic day to take action, Virgo. Your eagerness to strike out for new territory is heightened by a drive to experience the unknown. Take an internal journey and see what kind of wonderful things you can discover. There's a tremendous strength inside you that doesn't always get to show itself. This is the perfect day to prove your courage to the world.",Virgo
"Aug 2, 2022 - Cupid has fired his arrow into your heart today, Virgo, so snuggle up with the object of your desire. You'll feel more sensual and romantic than usual. Gourmet foods and fine wines should grace your plate tonight. Realize that there may be an element of restraint that needs to get worked into the equation, but don't let this stop you from having a good time.",Virgo
"Aug 3, 2022 - You'll find yourself working well with any group today, Virgo. There will be a great connection between you and the people around you. Make sure you ground your relationships in something meaningful or else you could find that you've built a whole reality out of something that doesn't exist. Be true to yourself and try not to get fooled by anything that seems too good to be true.",Virgo
"Aug 4, 2022 - Beware that creative efforts involving modern technology, such as computer graphics, recording, or film, might suffer from ""too many cooks."" Everyone has a different idea of how things should be handled. If this is your project, make sure everyone knows you're the boss. If you have partners, discuss the situation rationally with them. Don't sabotage your enterprise because of disagreements. Talk it over.",Virgo
"Aug 5, 2022 - You're in a unique position to understand all sides of the issues, Virgo. While this is apt to give you a tremendous advantage over those who still have their heads stuck in the sand, this knowledge also gives you a greater responsibility to others. You intuitively know what's best, and now you must find a way to bring others around and help them see it from your perspective.",Virgo
"Aug 6, 2022 - Your engine may sputter this morning as your gears begin to turn, Virgo. It could be that you're working out something important in your mind that's helping clarify your emotions. The answer you seek is probably nothing like the one you'll find. By the time night comes, you'll have everything figured out. All the answers you need will be right there in front of you.",Virgo
"Aug 7, 2022 - Meditation, dreams, or visions could bring amazing insights your way, Virgo. You might find them too bizarre to believe, at least at first, but follow-up research could reveal that what you've come up with is quite credible. Keep a journal of these revelations because you might remember the gist but forget the details. They could be useful later when you pass your ideas on to others.",Virgo
"Aug 8, 2022 - Frustration could tempt you to release that energy by spending a lot of money, Virgo. You might overindulge in food or drink or resort to impulse buying. Treat yourself a little, but don't go overboard. You don't want to get an upset stomach, and you won't want to have to take unwanted items back to the store. Get some exercise or throw your passion into creative pursuits.",Virgo
"Aug 9, 2022 - A female visitor who needs some sympathy could contact you today. She may want advice on some problems, Virgo, but she could also bring information, possibly involving new scientific or metaphysical studies that you find fascinating and that you'll want to relate to others. This information could trigger your own insights. Write down your ideas. You'll want to remember them.",Virgo
"Aug 10, 2022 - Some intense communications with a close friend or lover could reveal wonderful things about your relationship. Perhaps you have more in common than you thought. Maybe your fears and insecurities prove groundless. As a result, you two could grow closer and discover a new mutual sense of purpose. Enjoy the positive feelings that come your way and have a great day.",Virgo
"Aug 11, 2022 - Today you could decide to attend a virtual workshop or social event involving people in a spiritual, metaphysical, or intellectual field, Virgo. Fascinating talk could lead to your own insights and revelations. You could explore ways to harness your natural healing ability, perhaps through Reiki, massage, or another discipline. You'll be preoccupied with what you learn today.",Virgo
"Aug 12, 2022 - Money matters should be going well for you now, Virgo, so today you might decide to make a long-desired expenditure for your home. You might decide to buy furniture, do some redecorating, or even purchase a new home. Land investments might also warrant some consideration. Whatever you do, you'll enjoy it. The results could make a very positive difference in your home life. Enjoy.",Virgo
"Aug 13, 2022 - New ideas for your career could be on your mind, Virgo. You might be thinking not only about getting a new job but also entering an entirely new field. This could be a positive development, but don't be too impulsive and leap without thinking. List your options, cross out the unworkable ones, and do some research on the rest. Even though you may feel some urgency, there is none.",Virgo
"Aug 14, 2022 - You may feel a bit blue due to a nagging weightiness that pins you down to reality instead of being free to fly, Virgo. You may act out in an effort to prove to yourself and others that you're somehow above Earthly things. Get over the mental block that says being grounded is a bad thing. Plant your feet firmly on terra firma. That's how you find balance and attain your goals.",Virgo
"Aug 15, 2022 - Getting through any work you have to do shouldn't be a problem for you today, Virgo. Even if you flag for a bit, you're likely to get a second wind, and this will give you the drive and determination to see your projects to completion. Make plans for some fun after you're done, such as getting together with friends, if possible, or taking in an event that really intrigues you. You deserve it.",Virgo
"Aug 16, 2022 - Put your ambition into action today, Virgo. The day's planetary aspects should find you feeling energetic and positive, so take steps to achieve your goals. Nothing will happen if you don't actively pursue them. The years can pass quickly. You don't want to be sitting in a rocker wondering ""what if."" Trust yourself and do what it takes. Everything starts with that first step.",Virgo
"Aug 17, 2022 - You might need to be alone today, Virgo. You're probably surrounded by people most of the time. It can be unhealthy if you can't occasionally be alone with your thoughts and feelings. It's critical to take care of your emotional well-being, since you have a deeply sensitive nature. With all the continuous activity around you, make time to connect with this important part of you.",Virgo
"Aug 18, 2022 - Your active side may really show today, Virgo. While you can be extremely focused on ""thinking"" work, you can also love keeping active and enjoy physical work. When you have a project like cleaning your home, you can be quick when you put your mind to it. This is a good day to get a lot accomplished. You'll probably enjoy it very much and bask in the satisfaction afterwards.",Virgo
"Aug 19, 2022 - Are you living your dreams, Virgo? Are you still in touch with them? The energy from today's planetary aspects can lend strength and encouragement to this part of your life. Take hold of the things you want most of all. Ask yourself, ""What do I want people to say about me when I'm gone?"" Get back on the road to a fulfilled life by taking steps toward your desires.",Virgo
"Aug 20, 2022 - Today might be a good day to take a second shot at something that didn't work out the first time, Virgo. Falling flat on your face can damage your self-esteem and confidence, but such things are part of life, and they really do add character. By going back into the ring, you ensure that you build courage and perseverance.",Virgo
"Aug 21, 2022 - Feel free to speak more loudly today, Virgo. You'll find that things fall into place more easily if you speak your thoughts outwardly and directly in the presence of others. Bring your internal power under your control instead of becoming a victim of the control games played by others. Your sincere heart is easily manipulated, so be careful that you aren't getting the short end of the stick.",Virgo
"Aug 22, 2022 - You may need a translator to get through to people today, Virgo. It could be hard to make decisions, but not impossible. Today's tip is to err on the side of adventure. Trust that good luck will pull you through if you take risks. You may feel unappreciated. Ask for help when you need it, but don't rely on others to heal you. Most of this work needs to come from within.",Virgo
"Aug 23, 2022 - A friend or colleague could recommend some books that you want to read right away, Virgo. Be sure you take breaks and rest your eyes from time to time to avoid eyestrain and headaches today. It's also important to remember to get out and go for a walk, weather permitting. Your body needs stimulation as much as your mind, and a walk will clear your head. Enjoy your day.",Virgo
"Aug 24, 2022 - The formation of a new business partnership might transform your working life, Virgo. The benefits may not appear for a while, so don't quit your day job. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth considering. Make sure you have all the facts before making any formal commitment. It's important to be aware of every possible contingency before you start a new enterprise, especially now.",Virgo
"Aug 25, 2022 - Give people the benefit of the doubt today, Virgo. Even though you may not agree with everything going on around you, people have their reasons for the way they act and the way they are. This doesn't mean that you need to act in exactly the same manner. Stick to your routine and don't get thrown off track by the aggressive warrior in others.",Virgo
"Aug 26, 2022 - Find comfort in the people around you today, Virgo. Try not to take things too seriously. Don't feel like you need to internalize everyone else's problems. Take a step back from any situation that doesn't seem right to you. You may find conversation with new people to be extremely stimulating and rewarding. Keep your guard up, but don't let it block you from new experiences.",Virgo
"Aug 27, 2022 - Positive change rarely happens without effort. Keep this in mind as transformation occurs quickly. You may feel as though you're in the middle of a whirlpool and getting sucked deeper and deeper, unsure of where you'll ultimately end up. This is merely the ""nose to the grindstone"" phase. Trust that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded.",Virgo
"Aug 28, 2022 - Someone close to you might be uncharacteristically silent today, Virgo. Something is bothering them terribly, and they don't seem to want to talk about it. You're willing to listen or help, but don't try to coax your friend into sharing. Use your intuition to sense what's going on and do what you can to alleviate the situation. Your efforts won't go unnoticed or unappreciated.",Virgo
"Aug 29, 2022 - You're probably good at applying your spiritual principles to the way you live, Virgo. You're especially good at it today, particularly when it comes to understanding others deeply. Relationships of all kinds will likely grow and improve, at least those that matter. Those that don't will disappear. This is a time of great outer and inner change for you. Make the most of it!",Virgo
"Aug 30, 2022 - Emotionally, you should be doing well today, Virgo. But when it comes to taking action, you're apt to be indecisive. Every option seems to look fantastic. You probably aren't going to want to miss out on anything. The best thing for you to do is try to get a piece of everything. There are many pies to dip your fingers into. Why not taste them all to see which one you like best?",Virgo
"Aug 31, 2022 - Don't take everything at face value today, Virgo. Information you receive might not be accurate. Someone could be repeating gossip or even creating it just to have something to talk about. Don't take part in the discussion. Since your workload is likely heavy, forego the socializing in favor of finishing the tasks in front of you.",Virgo
"Sep 1, 2022 - Get to some water today and reconnect with this element, Virgo. Like lapping waves against the shore, you may be gently changing the landscape around you with each word or action. Don't underestimate your inner strength. It could be that you seem overpowered by the things going on around you, but don't let them keep you from being the person you truly are.",Virgo
"Sep 2, 2022 - Friends could entice you to join them for a short day trip, perhaps to the country. This is a great day to go on such an outing if it’s possible, Virgo. You've probably been working hard and need to get away for a while. Don't be surprised if there's a delay, however. You or one of your friends could be waiting to talk with someone.",Virgo
"Sep 3, 2022 - Today you might be fascinated with movies, music, and video. You could discover a new interest in filmmaking, sound engineering, or videography that you want to pursue. You might decide to read about these fields and apply what you learn to the movies you see and the music you hear. If you're serious about learning these skills, this is the time to go for it. You'll enjoy it!",Virgo
"Sep 4, 2022 - This is a good day to follow through on projects, Virgo. Leaving many unfinished matters in your life only creates clutter that keeps other things from entering the picture. Either dismiss the project entirely or finish it and move on to something else. Don't leave things hanging, including people. Tell others what's going on and you'll be more successful in the long run.",Virgo
"Sep 5, 2022 - You should wake up feeling hopeful and optimistic about the future, Virgo. Your self-confidence is stronger than usual, and your enthusiasm is contagious. Success in joint efforts should have you glowing with satisfaction. You could even receive public acknowledgment of your efforts. Today bodes well for relationships of all kinds, particularly romantic ones. Celebrate your good fortune with a lover tonight!",Virgo
"Sep 6, 2022 - You may have strange dreams and vivid premonitions today, Virgo. Your intuition and telepathic faculties are operating at a high level. You could think of someone who later phones. There's also a tendency to be too paranoid. Don't panic if some of the messages you receive seem disturbing. Check out the facts first. You're likely to find that all is better than you thought",Virgo
"Sep 7, 2022 - Misinformation might spread through your extended family or neighborhood and cause unnecessary upsets among those involved. Don't accept at face value any gossip or rumor you hear today until you check it out yourself, Virgo. It could turn out to be a tempest in a teapot. This isn't a good time to plan or take a trip of any kind. Delays or mishaps could result.",Virgo
"Sep 8, 2022 - Express your independence today, Virgo, and prove to others that you won't be pushed around anymore. Do things for yourself and have fun while you do it. Your heart will know which way is the right way to proceed. Don't be fooled by those who try to tell you otherwise. Success comes when you can initiate others into your world instead of you being seduced by theirs.",Virgo
"Sep 9, 2022 - A friend could ask for a loan and you might hesitate to give him or her the money. Follow your instincts. The person probably isn't too savvy about money. You might want to participate in some group activities, but don't let people take unfair advantage of you. You're willing to serve those who need you but discriminate between those who do and don't really need your help.",Virgo
"Sep 10, 2022 - It looks as though change is on the horizon at work, Virgo. You've just recently completed some long-term projects and are being recognized for your efforts. Perhaps a bonus or promotion is in store. Your affinity for technology and ability to quickly absorb new information makes you a prime candidate for a new position that's just opened up. Grab the chance!",Virgo
"Sep 11, 2022 - Artistic talents are greatly increased by fresh, deeply felt inspiration. Today you may spend much of your time giving material form to your ideas. You're intuitive by nature, but today your psychic gifts are operating at a high level. Don't write off any insights you receive. Instead, write them down. Don't forget to keep paper and pen next to your bed. You'll want to remember your ideas and dreams later.",Virgo
"Sep 12, 2022 - Some disconcerting revelations about your past or the past of someone close to you could come out today. This might be a bit of a shock, Virgo, but it's a positive development, nonetheless. It will shed some light on how to deal with current issues in your life or a relationship. Write down your thoughts, meditate, talk to a friend, or otherwise try to make sense of it.",Virgo
"Sep 13, 2022 - An opportunity to bring in extra income might arrive today, Virgo, possibly through a female friend. Another Virgo might be involved. This probably involves a special, temporary project, but it could prove enjoyable and profitable. A love partner might want to participate, too. Think about it before committing. Talk to people who have done this before. It's worth a try, anyway.",Virgo
"Sep 14, 2022 - Your fantasy life is especially active today, Virgo, so enjoy this little break into your dream world. Coming back to reality may be difficult. Keep tabs on your emotions so they don't get the better of you. The impressions you receive from the outside world may not be accurate today. Keep your wits about you and try not to get caught up in drugs and alcohol.",Virgo
"Sep 15, 2022 - Things flow well for you today, Virgo, so bask in any sunshine that this day offers. Your intuition is especially strong, and you have an uncanny ability to pick up on other people's feelings. Your nurturing gifts are in high demand by those around you. They'll need a sensitive shoulder to lean on. Just make sure you don't lose yourself in the process. Save some energy for you.",Virgo
"Sep 16, 2022 - Communication is likely to be warm, informative, and companionable today, Virgo, and you'll probably grow closer to those around you because of it. Your inspiration and imagination flow freely, and you're likely to want to channel much of your energy into creative projects. You may also want to phone a friend who shares your artistic interests.",Virgo
"Sep 17, 2022 - Have you been thinking about changing careers, Virgo? You might hear of some opportunities today, possibly through a colleague. This could be the right time to make a change. Positive professional developments are indicated for you. List your options and then do some research on each one. You might be headed toward some exciting possibilities.",Virgo
"Sep 18, 2022 - The opportunity to fly somewhere might come up today, Virgo. Career changes are in the wind, and while they might seem rather unsettling at first, they'll be positive in the long run. This could involve a raise or promotion, transfer, new job, or even new career. Don't fight it. It might be scary, but it's a blessing in disguise. Go with the flow.",Virgo
"Sep 19, 2022 - Be on your toes today, Virgo, and expect the unexpected. People may be acting out in rash, outlandish ways, so go with the flow. As usual, you have a tremendous ability to roll with the punches and still come out unscathed. Just take care that someone else isn't grabbing the reins. Stay laid-back while maintaining control of your actions.",Virgo
"Sep 20, 2022 - Inspiration could hit today, Virgo. It's a beautiful feeling, but you might not be sure how to channel it. It could represent a spiritual breakthrough, artistic inspiration, increased understanding of others, or all of the above. What's almost certain is that you'll want to spend time alone to take it all in and figure out how to use it. Don't dismiss any possibility, however outrageous it may seem.",Virgo
"Sep 21, 2022 - Is your significant other caught up in family problems and unable to spend time with you? Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. Your partner needs to deal with family now. Relax, do what you want to do, and have confidence that you'll be spending more time together as soon as possible. After dealing with family quarrels, you'll be a peaceful refuge for your partner.",Virgo
"Sep 22, 2022 - Expect to receive interesting communications today, Virgo. You might hear from a long-lost friend and have a chance to catch up on the news. Perhaps you'll hear something about success in reaching a goal you've been striving for these past few months. Expect some interesting conversations. Have a great time exchanging ideas on everything from politics to child rearing.",Virgo
"Sep 23, 2022 - Your phone may seem haunted today, Virgo. Calls might be filled with static, you could get some phantom rings, or callers may insist they tried to call when your phone never rang. There probably isn't any supernatural force at work, but it might be a good idea check with your phone company. There could be problems with your equipment.",Virgo
"Sep 24, 2022 - An online prayer or meditation group could meet tonight, Virgo, and you may get carried away with the spiritual dimensions these meditations take on. You feel comfortable with the people in this group, and you're grateful for the friendship and support they provide. Be with this feeling tonight, and try to hang onto it for as long as you can. It can help you through some rough times.",Virgo
"Sep 25, 2022 - You're ready for something new and different, Virgo. What better time than during the current transits to put into practice what has only been a dream? You may decide to work for yourself or ditch one relationship in favor of another. You want the changes you implement to be brash and far-reaching! If not, you may have to wait a long time to feel this energetic and optimistic again.",Virgo
"Sep 26, 2022 - A virtual class or lecture of some kind could bring you exciting new information today, Virgo. This could keep your mind buzzing for hours, particularly since you may also communicate with some interesting people with whom you can discuss this subject for hours. Make the effort to take a walk and clear your head at some point during the day or else you might be too mentally charged up to sleep.",Virgo
"Sep 27, 2022 - Happiness reigns in the home as everyone feels the energy changing, Virgo. It seems that the end of one cycle brings closure, and now you're free to start a new journey of rebirth. You, above all, are apt to feel a powerful rush of intuition, which could reveal positive events coming up for you and those close to you. A few doubts may cloud your impressions, but let them go.",Virgo
"Sep 28, 2022 - A small gathering of some kind could attract you and your family tonight, Virgo. Perhaps you will arrange to meet some friends there, if possible. You may feel good just being out with those you love, but you're likely to be tired by the end of the event. Make sure you fortify yourself with nourishing food during the day. Take care of yourself so you can have some fun.",Virgo
"Sep 29, 2022 - You will probably encounter a bit of opposition along with today's planetary energies, Virgo. Even those who are usually right behind you will seem uncooperative. Try not to let this faze you too much. Resolve to follow your own instincts and work alone if need be. Once you've had a chance to advance your ideas further along on your own, you can present them again.",Virgo
"Sep 30, 2022 - Don't let yourself be manipulated by needy friends, Virgo. With today's planetary energies, it's a good time to think about setting clear boundaries. You know which friends are there for you and lift you up and which ones tend to drain all your time and energy with the constant need for your immediate attention. Try saying no. You can't fix other people's lives for them anyway. Think about it.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"Oct 1, 2022 - Happiness reigns in the home right now, Virgo. Money comes pouring in from bonuses, salary from extra hours, or gifts. You may be considering spending some of this money on either adding to or refurbishing your home. If you're having trouble making a decision, consider consulting a decorator. There is great harmony within your family. You seem to understand each other on an intuitive level.",Virgo
"Oct 2, 2022 - Today may be one of those days in which you come to a four-way stop and no one knows whose turn it is. Don't sit and wait for everyone else to go first, Virgo. If you know it's your turn, be bold and make your move. It wouldn't be a bad idea to signal others that you're going ahead. People might not be used to you taking such an aggressive role.",Virgo
"Oct 3, 2022 - This is a good time to take a stand on an issue that you may have been vacillating about lately, Virgo. People will lose confidence in you if you can't seem to make up your mind. What they don't realize is that you've been working overtime to process all the information. Now it's time to express orally what you've discovered mentally.",Virgo
"Oct 4, 2022 - Engage more of your rational mind today, Virgo. If your mind continues on its track into a fantasy world, you might consider enlisting the help of people who can help you bring some discipline to your situation. For you, the general feeling of the day is likely to be that the mind is willing, but the flesh is weak. Let others help you get inspired to get out of lazy mode.",Virgo
"Oct 5, 2022 - The planetary energy might find you responding to a sudden sense of inspiration that arouses your creativity. You may feel an unexpected urge to write, paint, draw, or compose some music. You may want to sequester yourself, which could cause some problems with friends and family members who want to be on close contact with you. Don't ignore this impetus, Virgo. As you know, inspiration can vanish as quickly as it comes.",Virgo
"Oct 6, 2022 - Your dreams work out quite nicely in your head, Virgo, but the problem now is how to turn them into some sort of real-life scenario. Be careful of taking too intellectual of an approach. When it comes to relationships, things don't normally happen logically or rationally. You're going to have to leave a great deal up to chance, so just learn to deal with things as they come.",Virgo
"Oct 7, 2022 - Appreciate the good things you have today, Virgo. Don't let another day go by without really paying homage to the people who've helped you grow along the way. Take a walk. Climb a tree or help a child build a tree house. Connect with your spiritual side that finds satisfaction in where you are now instead of always feeling a need to search for something bigger and better.",Virgo
"Oct 8, 2022 - You may be wondering whose shoulder you should cry on, Virgo. Usually yours is the shoulder that everyone else likes to use. The collar of your shirt is probably soaking wet by now, thanks to all the tears that have spilled on you. Your compassion for others is definitely one of your biggest strengths but be aware of the fact that it can also be one of your biggest weaknesses.",Virgo
"Oct 9, 2022 - Although you may find it hard to express yourself in some ways, Virgo, the one avenue that's completely wide open today is art. Difficult tension is laced with emotional insecurity, making it hard for you to express your feelings. If you feel that this is the case, find some other means of expressing these emotions. A large canvas and some paints will work quite nicely.",Virgo
"Oct 10, 2022 - Vague aches and pains could have you feeling a little under the weather, Virgo. You may not be able to discern why you have these pains, since there's no apparent reason. Don't assume the worst. Your condition is probably just due to a little intensified nerve strain and extra stress. Take it easy and relax today. Go back to your usual routine tomorrow.",Virgo
"Oct 11, 2022 - Some people who share your interests could call you today. You might want to take a walk while on the phone with each other, but you will probably get into some stimulating debates. Don't be surprised if you both talk at once! New books that you will want to read could come to your attention. In the evening, stream some movies on whatever subject you've discussed.",Virgo
"Oct 12, 2022 - A warm and loving communication could come to you today from someone close. This could be an email, call, or even a gift of some kind. This could make your day, Virgo, and you will probably pass whatever good feelings you draw from it to other friends and family members. Take a walk around your neighborhood and say hello to whomever you meet. It will make you feel even better!",Virgo
"Oct 13, 2022 - Expect many advantageous changes to take place in your community, Virgo. New businesses could open their doors, interesting neighbors could move in, or some necessary repairs could finally get done. You might spend a lot of time in the car or on the phone and spreading the news. An exciting proposition may come to you or someone close to you through a letter, email, or phone call.",Virgo
"Oct 14, 2022 - This is the right moment to extricate yourself from relationships that have seen their day, Virgo. This won't be easy, but you must. In your professional and private lives, you're too hesitant to get out of distasteful situations or obligations. You're afraid of hurting people or making them mad. But in the end, you're hurting yourself. Give more weight to your own needs and follow your own path.",Virgo
"Oct 15, 2022 - An exciting rush of physical passion could hit you today when you're introduced to an interesting new person, Virgo. Take care not to wear it on your face. You generally don't like to reveal that much of yourself! Besides, you won't want this person to think you're too obvious. Try to stay focused and remain objective. Then consider whether it's a good idea to pursue this attraction.",Virgo
"Oct 16, 2022 - Jump-start the day with a smile, Virgo. Your generosity and sincerity won't go unnoticed on a day like this. People will probably need more attention than usual, so take the time to attend to the emotions of those you love. The key is to not let yourself get emotionally drained in the process. Fill yourself up with the lively, fun-loving energy of the day.",Virgo
"Oct 17, 2022 - Don't let fear of failure or fear of success hold you back, Virgo. Even though you may feel a natural tendency to want to shrink into the background and take the easiest route, you might be sacrificing your true purpose when you do. Become the leader instead of following the leader. Rid yourself of all fear and take control of your destiny.",Virgo
"Oct 18, 2022 - Make sure your opinion doesn't get lost in the frenzy of the day, Virgo. Your words may not quite fit with the things that people want to hear. Try not to take this personally. Realize that this isn't an indication that your words are any less important. You have an incredible gift of being able to see things that others can't. Cherish and nourish this ability instead of invalidating it.",Virgo
"Oct 19, 2022 - Your best plan of attack today is to not attack at all, Virgo. There is enough aggressiveness out there. You don't need to add any more to the fray. Let others duke it out. Your job is to wait until the dust settles. Try not to get involved in other people's disputes. You might get dragged further into the situation than makes you feel comfortable.",Virgo
"Oct 20, 2022 - You will feel much better about yourself if you get things done today, Virgo. Like a meal that tastes good but isn't necessarily good for you, you might enjoy this day by being lazy, but you won't feel so good when night comes and you realize that you haven't accomplished anything. Use the day productively so you have a sense of fulfillment by tonight.",Virgo
"Oct 21, 2022 - This is a good time to put things in writing, Virgo. Your gift with words is apt to shine today as you write a proposal, email, or love poem. You're able to communicate very well when you put your sensitive emotions aside and concentrate on what you think instead of what you feel. Expand your influence by focusing on those things that require a more cerebral approach.",Virgo
"Oct 22, 2022 - Group activities are probably very much on your agenda today, Virgo. You could attend an online meeting or lecture and later participate in a group chat with a bunch of friends. Don't be tempted to eat or drink too much. You'll likely regret it tomorrow. An unexpected sum of extra money could come your way. Don't spend it all in one place. This is a great day to concentrate on having fun - within limits.",Virgo
"Oct 23, 2022 - Someone you've been expecting to call might not do so today, Virgo, and this could worry you a little. Don't be too shy to pick up the phone and call. Your friend may have overslept or been too overwhelmed by work or family life. You haven't been forgotten. If you phone, this person will undoubtedly be glad to hear from you. After the conversation, go for a walk in your neighborhood.",Virgo
"Oct 24, 2022 - Discoveries made through occult sciences such as astrology or numerology could see you embrace some rather revolutionary ideas about yourself, the world, and life. You could become involved with a group associated with metaphysical studies or take an online class or workshop of some kind. This could mean a new direction for you in some way, Virgo. It might greatly enhance your life and thinking.",Virgo
"Oct 25, 2022 - Your imagination is working overtime today, Virgo, and you might spend hours at a computer writing or in front of an easel or piano creating your own brand of painting or music. This drive to create comes from the heart and shouldn't be ignored no matter what other issues come up. Take care of whatever needs to be handled and then follow your inspiration. You may be surprised at what you produce!",Virgo
"Oct 26, 2022 - Your mind is likely to be going a thousand miles an hour today, Virgo. Thoughts and ideas are pouring into your head like rain from the sky. Some of them might be confusing and others contradictory. You might be tempted to puzzle over them until you give yourself a headache. Write them down and look at them in a day or two. Your ideas are more likely to make sense to you then.",Virgo
"Oct 27, 2022 - Gatherings in your neighborhood could bring new and interesting information your way, Virgo. A message from an acquaintance could send you down a new path toward a new goal. Relations with everyone around you - from your romantic partner to the most casual of acquaintances - should be warm and congenial. Conversations should be stimulating.",Virgo
"Oct 28, 2022 - Today you might perform some service to people who live in your neighborhood. Perhaps you will chauffeur people around to do their shopping. Perhaps you will help people with household tasks. Pets may also need some attention. Whatever it is, you will enjoy helping in whatever way is possible, and be appreciated as well. Expect to have a very busy day. You will certainly sleep soundly tonight.",Virgo
"Oct 29, 2022 - A community issue may come up today concerning you and your neighbors, Virgo. Perhaps a virtual meeting will be held. Something requires change in your neighborhood, and most of you are probably firmly united behind it. This bodes well for your future, so you will probably feel good about the entire situation after the gathering breaks up. Onward and upward!",Virgo
"Oct 30, 2022 - Your actions may go against your rational thinking, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, Virgo. Thoughts and feelings are apt to aggressively clash today, but that doesn't mean you have to be a victim of the resulting demolition. Note the big pieces that survive after the initial impact. Recognize these as your strengths and work to build them back up while leaving the smaller pieces behind.",Virgo
"Oct 31, 2022 - You may feel like you're on a cliff with your legs dangling over the edge, Virgo. You're searching for handholds while your feet struggle to support you on a tiny ledge. You may be swearing that when you get out of this predicament, you will never come this way again. Take heart. This is all part of the cycle. These necessary challenges only make you stronger and more appreciative of the easy stretches.",Virgo
"Nov 1, 2022 - If you're in the market for romance, Virgo, whether with a new partner or rekindling the fire with a current partner, be careful. Small issues could rage out control today. Extreme conditions are likely to occur, thanks to your sensitive emotions combined with a surge of energy from the outside. Try not to get too upset when tension rises because of something unimportant.",Virgo
"Nov 2, 2022 - Your physical energy is very high today, Virgo. You're likely to want to get out and exercise, perhaps jog through the park or attend a virtual aerobics class. Be careful! You might not be as fit as you think and trying too hard could cause minor injuries. Someone you know professionally might not be in a great mood. You could get swept up in their anger. Try to stay out of it.",Virgo
"Nov 3, 2022 - Virgo, the people around you sometimes have a hard time understanding where you're going. You're living in an imaginary world that has little to do with reality. If you decide to stay home and lie around the house, you will have no problems. If you have to go to work, try to be as clear as possible with others. If you don't, your proposals could fall on deaf ears.",Virgo
"Nov 4, 2022 - You can interpret today's aspects in several ways, Virgo. The planetary configurations correspond to a search for space, whether physical or intellectual. You may be asking yourself philosophical questions, or perhaps you're thinking of taking a long trip in the future. What will you decide to do? Will you read Kant or plan your dream trip?",Virgo
"Nov 5, 2022 - You have a good heart, Virgo, and today it expands to bestow love on all mankind. You can't help but feel connected in a deep, spiritual way with all who have come before you and all who follow. Even if you don't have a lot of money, consider setting up an annual giving plan that will benefit worthwhile causes. This would be a direct expression of your feelings and could potentially help many people.",Virgo
"Nov 6, 2022 - Don't expect others to take much notice of your emotions today, Virgo. You're more respectful of theirs than they are of yours. Find peace among all you encounter. This could be difficult since other people's wills are involved. In that case, people aren't likely to back down. Others think they're right and refuse to see things any other way.",Virgo
"Nov 7, 2022 - If you have children, their difficulties may remind you of your own, Virgo. Or it may simply be that their education brings back memories of yours. Are you holding onto an issue from a period in your life that still bothers you? This would be a good moment to ask yourself the question. Ask it, then answer it and put it to rest once and for all!",Virgo
"Nov 8, 2022 - This would be the moment to say yes to your destiny, Virgo. You're a little frustrated because things haven't been moving forward the way you'd like. But now that opportunities are coming your way, you find you're holding things up. You're just afraid, that's all. But rather than let your fear overtake you, turn its energy to your advantage.",Virgo
"Nov 9, 2022 - You may be worn out, Virgo, but you will have to push forward anyway. You're entering a long period of work and perseverance. This definitely isn't the moment to be late or balk. If you're still in your pajamas at noon, you should be ashamed! Do what you can to wake yourself from your recent daze. It's time to get up and get moving!",Virgo
"Nov 10, 2022 - Here's a day that will be rather calm for you, Virgo. Peace has replaced all your soul searching. You feel in contact with life's daily routine, including aspects that you don't always consider like the weather, people's expressions, or small coincidences. You seem to be floating on a cloud. You're going to have a good deal of confidence today!",Virgo
"Nov 11, 2022 - Sensual, passionate lovemaking is definitely on the agenda of activities for tonight, Virgo. Fun, excitement, romance, and love are all key themes likely to take precedence if you have anything to say about it - and you do. Don't let someone else dictate your path for you. You know what you want, so don't say you don't care when you do. Love is coming your way. Learn how to grab it.",Virgo
"Nov 12, 2022 - What are you after in life, Virgo? Deep down, does the kind of work you do satisfy your most intimate desires? The little problems you encounter in your professional life over the next week could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Take a look around to see if the work you do and the people in your life take your profoundly spiritual nature into account.",Virgo
"Nov 13, 2022 - Events over which you seem to have no control seem to be coming together to make things happen for you, Virgo. You might find this a bit frightening, but don't let it get to you. Go with the flow. You've worked hard for what's happening today, and you deserve to enjoy the results. The exhilaration you feel could manifest as abundant physical energy. This could be too much of a good thing. Don't overdo.",Virgo
"Nov 14, 2022 - Your mind is full of wonderful thoughts today, Virgo. You might consider spending the day meditating, doing some volunteer work, or turning your inspiration into an artistic project of some kind. Your intuition is especially high, so you might tune in more acutely than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others. Take a few minutes during the day to be alone with your thoughts. You will probably benefit from it.",Virgo
"Nov 15, 2022 - You have an incredible imagination, Virgo. Today is a great day to put it to use. Take time to engage in creative activities and try meditation, story planning, role playing, or visualization. You have a powerful tool to unlock inner fears and inhibitions, increasing your confidence and creativity and solving life's challenges. If this is a new idea for you, consider learning more about meditation to connect with your inner self.",Virgo
"Nov 16, 2022 - Be careful not to fall prey to your own idealism today, Virgo. While this is one of your most admirable qualities, as it contributes to your romantic, creative nature, too much of anything can be harmful. It's important to see things as they are, despite how much you may wish them to be different. The real world doesn't always go hand in hand with your ideal place. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts.",Virgo
"Nov 17, 2022 - This is one of those days when the road forks in several directions and you must decide which way to go, Virgo. This usually isn't hard. You just go with the flow. But now things are flowing in multiple directions and you need to figure out which way to go. Stick with the way that seems most natural. Remember that whatever choice you make will be the right one.",Virgo
"Nov 18, 2022 - Within the next few days, you're likely to gain access to dimensions of perception you never suspected, Virgo. Perhaps you will become aware of certain energy phenomena, peak experiences, or other highly sensitive states of consciousness. Don't be frightened. Instead, investigate what these worlds have to offer. What you learn will help you cope with your sensitivity.",Virgo
"Nov 19, 2022 - Deep inside, don't you have an urge to breathe new spirit into your love life? Of course, some things are more easily said than done. Currently, you don't have much time to devote to yourself, much less your partner. Affection could thrive if given half a chance. The day suggests that you commit yourself to making some decisions that will help bring you and your mate closer.",Virgo
"Nov 20, 2022 - You will be full of ideas for improving your lifestyle, Virgo, especially as it relates to your family. It's true that over the past few months you've experienced some hardships. You can breathe easier now. Whether it's for your career or home, today's initiatives are likely to bring great rewards. Take advantage of the atmosphere to put together a realistic plan for the future.",Virgo
"Nov 21, 2022 - Today your mind might be on social and political issues. If you aren't currently involved with groups dealing with these issues, you might consider joining one. A recent increase in income might have given you some extra time, and you may be excited about the possibilities. Service to others is one, Virgo. Consider some others, perhaps developing a creative skill, before moving ahead.",Virgo
"Nov 22, 2022 - After the events of the last few weeks, do you still want to continue acting like the same person? This is always a good question to ask with a celestial atmosphere like today's. People generally feel that they have a chance to get out of old systems and relationships. But people always hesitate to do this because of a fear of the future. Don't waver. Take the next steps!",Virgo
"Nov 23, 2022 - In an attempt to merge with infinity, you might overlook some basic life principles, Virgo. Be careful about being seduced by those who want you to be involved in their drama. You might willingly acquiesce at first. You may not even realize how deep a hole you've dug until it's too late. Make sure you haven't alienated everyone so that there's still someone left to dig you out.",Virgo
"Nov 24, 2022 - Mundane tasks, including errands and answering correspondence, might bore you all day, Virgo. You're likely to be restless and strongly tempted to chuck it all and go somewhere to enjoy yourself. Take a good look at what you're doing and try to judge objectively how important it is to get it done now. If it isn't that important, then put it aside. You probably need to relax!",Virgo
"Nov 25, 2022 - Your sensitive heart may be sparked by anger today, Virgo. Don't be afraid of hurting other people's feelings. You'd be doing yourself and others a disservice by not revealing the true scope of your emotions. The other parties involved may not have all the facts necessary to make the most educated decision. Aid in this process by revealing your perspective.",Virgo
"Nov 26, 2022 - Your thin skin feels even thinner than usual today, Virgo. If you happen to witness a violent outburst in the street, at work, or on television, you suddenly become aware of your vulnerability. Don't let it frighten you into hiding. As one of the few remaining guardians of the world's dwindling reserves of kindness, you have a responsibility.",Virgo
"Nov 27, 2022 - You're often called the ""cleanup crew."" Whether it's the home or the unconscious, you enjoy preparing nests for all sorts of births, real and figurative. Don't be surprised if you find yourself tidying up your home, throwing away useless things, clearing the desk, or catching up on mail. There are powerful forces compelling you to prepare for someone or something new and different.",Virgo
"Nov 28, 2022 - The energy is apt to pick up in your life today, Virgo. You may be asked to report to duty. Don't make promises you can't keep. Your words will be taken seriously, and you shouldn't mislead people into thinking that something is going to happen when you know it isn't. You know how that situation will turn out. Trust yourself, regardless of the circumstances.",Virgo
"Nov 29, 2022 - Feel free to let it all out today, Virgo. It's finally your turn to stand up and say what you feel. Don't let others push you into places you don't want to be. The key is to probe deeply with your penetrating mind and share your incredible insights with others. Don't be surprised if your actions cause some tension. Don't let this stop you from doing what you feel is right.",Virgo
"Nov 30, 2022 - This is the right moment to extricate yourself from relationships that have seen their day, Virgo. This won't be easy, but you must. In your professional and private lives, you're too hesitant to get out of distasteful situations or obligations. You're afraid of hurting people or making them mad. But in the end, you're hurting yourself. Give more weight to your own needs and follow your own path.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Virgo. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",Virgo
"Dec 1, 2022 - You might long for a vacation today, Virgo, and you could toy with the idea of a future journey by air. Your mind may turn to spiritual places such as India, Egypt, Israel, or Ireland as you wonder how it would feel to stand in the sacred places in those countries. Don't just toy with the idea. You're probably overdue for a trip that would suit your mystical nature.",Virgo
"Dec 2, 2022 - You may have been a bit indecisive lately when it comes to love and romance, Virgo. Perhaps your mind is drawn to one person while your heart is drawn to another. Perhaps you're trying to trick your mind into seeing a certain quality in someone while you ignore parts that you don't really like. Make sure you accept people for all of who they are and not just the individual parts.",Virgo
"Dec 3, 2022 - Indecision may leave you helpless at a crossroads today, Virgo. Others around you could be just as undecided regarding their direction. At the same time, you may feel pressured to take immediate action and you're tired of waiting for others to make the first move. Find answers in simple solutions. There's more than one correct way to go. Your choice is the right one if you believe it.",Virgo
"Dec 4, 2022 - You might need to spend time alone in order to reset your programming, Virgo. Other people's influence may be seeping into your psyche. There's no reason to always do or say what other people dictate. Your sensitivity helps you understand things about others, but it can also bring you down if you start to take on their burdens. Try to counterbalance this tendency with more of your own energy.",Virgo
"Dec 5, 2022 - Dress in your very best today, Virgo. Feel free to kick up your heels and have some fun. This is a great time to communicate with friends, socialize if possible, and have a fabulous time. Put your worries aside and join in some lighthearted fun and merriment. Keep a smile on your face and you will find that you can walk through any door you choose.",Virgo
"Dec 6, 2022 - You will probably be perfectly in tune with the day ahead, Virgo. Of course, it's tempting to run away from the reality and hardships of the moment. But at other times, when you're so compassionate and find it easy to listen, like today, life is really rewarding. People find your company soothing and pleasant, and they're likely to thank you for it. Aren't days like this great?",Virgo
"Dec 7, 2022 - Don't hesitate to speak up for what is right, Virgo, even if it means confronting someone with power. So be it. The slightest injustice can't be tolerated. When you voice your opinion, as you feel compelled to do, it makes others respect you. This has been a long time coming, and it does you a tremendous amount of good!",Virgo
"Dec 8, 2022 - Anger and resentment caused by past hurts could come up today, at times tempting you to burst into tears. Don't fight it. Just find someplace where you can be alone and let it out. This is only a symptom of personal and spiritual growth on your part. Releasing the past clears the way for breakthroughs in the future. You could wake up tomorrow morning feeling like a changed person!",Virgo
"Dec 9, 2022 - Lovely dreams could spark your imagination and get your artistic abilities going. You could learn a lot about yourself and whatever has been limiting you. Write down whatever comes your way so you can work with it later, but don't try to make sense of it today. Wait a while and then consider everything in a more practical light. You may be surprised at the difference in you.",Virgo
"Dec 10, 2022 - An unexpected, upsetting letter or phone call might come today. This isn't major bad news, Virgo. It's more likely to be the irritating little setbacks that force you to go more out of your way than you'd expected. Problems might pop up with computers, cell phones, or other forms of technology. Grit your teeth and do what it takes to move on. It won't help to get crazy.",Virgo
"Dec 11, 2022 - Your boat is likely to be rocked today, Virgo, to the point where you and all of your belongings could go overboard. Be prepared to swim ashore. Grounding and stability are the keys to maintaining a healthy attitude, especially when it comes to ever-fluctuating emotions. Issues regarding the home and people's possessions are likely to surface in a dramatic manner. Listen to your heart for the answers.",Virgo
"Dec 12, 2022 - Reward yourself with two desserts today, Virgo. Take a bubble bath. Share your fantasies with others and express yourself fully. Don't feel like you have to say yes to every favor that is asked of you. Save some of that nurturing energy for yourself. Feel free to help others in need, but don't do it at the expense of your emotional and physical bank account.",Virgo
"Dec 13, 2022 - You may be tempted to shift into high gear today, Virgo, but you're likely to be unsure where to focus your energy. You may be revved up and anxious to get moving but feel lazy and unmotivated to do anything but sit back and wait for the excitement to come to you. Whatever you do, don't retreat into a hole. Dress up and show off your outer as well as inner beauty.",Virgo
"Dec 14, 2022 - Today could be an unusual one for you emotionally, Virgo. Your usual easygoing, adaptable nature could be ruffled by people who try to take over projects that you are perfectly qualified to do. In such situations, you would normally retire gracefully to a quiet corner, but now you spread your beautiful wings and let it be known that you should not be overlooked.",Virgo
"Dec 15, 2022 - Bring your thoughts down to Earth, Virgo, especially later tonight. You may be flip-flopping through the day like a fish out of water, but suddenly things start to fall into place at sundown. You will find that people are much more caring and sensitive to your mood later this evening. Spend it at home with someone you love. Ground yourself and plan for the upcoming week.",Virgo
"Dec 16, 2022 - Finish whatever you didn't wrap up yesterday, Virgo. Use the morning to plan, the afternoon to execute, and the evening to relax. Be conscious of time and your physical and mental limitations. Bring your dreaminess down to Earth and be realistic about goals. Take time to put the extra coat of wax on the car or extra stitch in the fabric. That effort will serve you well in the long run.",Virgo
"Dec 17, 2022 - It may not be the easiest day to relate to others, Virgo, but as usual, if you just go with the flow, you will find that you can have fun. Try not to get caught up in anyone else's drama. There are likely to be soap operas playing all around you, and you would do well to steer clear of them. Maintain a lighthearted attitude today and try not to read into anything too deeply.",Virgo
"Dec 18, 2022 - Virgo, life around you today almost seems like a (bad) dream. It's almost as if people are talking, but nothing intelligible is coming out of their mouths. Perhaps two people close to you are having problems getting along. You feel like stepping in and telling them to calm down and really listen to each other. Days like these are when people need you the most.",Virgo
"Dec 19, 2022 - Today could be a turning point for you, Virgo. Is it possible that you've finally learned how to say no? You're the one everyone asks for help. You spend so much time on other people's problems that you have little energy left for you. This situation ultimately helps no one. Put yourself first and there will be plenty of you left for others. If you're depleted, everyone loses.",Virgo
"Dec 20, 2022 - Certain very narrow-minded people may get on your nerves. You're lucky enough to be an open, tolerant person, Virgo. You take people and situations just as they come. Today you may find yourself in the middle of negotiations between two people with opposite views. Help them open their eyes to each other's point of view.",Virgo
"Dec 21, 2022 - Your thinking is clear today, Virgo, and you will find that generally things are running smoothly. Your perspective on everything is very much in line with where you need to be at this time. In other words, you're doing everything exactly right. Be yourself and let other people adapt to your way of thinking. There's no need to keep hiding the truth of who you really are.",Virgo
"Dec 22, 2022 - You will find strength in your inner reserves today, Virgo. Don't hesitate to let your deepest thoughts shine through. Keep your antenna up. You will find that there's an electricity in the air that keeps people's emotions at peak level. Follow your instincts and keep in mind that this is probably your best defense against the challenges of the day. Rational thinking is overrated.",Virgo
"Dec 23, 2022 - The element of water predominates today. You will likely be aware of it by the strong tides of feeling in your household, Virgo. Some family members may be unhappy. They may need more independence or look to you for more attention and affection. It's hard to strike the right balance, as you will discover. Do your best to satisfy everyone, making sure that your own needs don't get overlooked.",Virgo
"Dec 24, 2022 - You have tremendous creativity inside you, Virgo. Have you begun to use some of it? This creative cycle will last for the next month or so. Don't let it pass without taking advantage of it. Use the other side of your brain for a change. Take up sketching, painting, or fiction writing. What you do is less important than doing something. The simple act of creation unlocks the brain.",Virgo
"Dec 25, 2022 - Sink into a soft, gentle rhythm and you flow with everything around you, Virgo. Ease your mind about any worries. Your subconscious knows the way. The key today is sensitivity and intuition - your specialties. You don't need to be concerned about a thing. Everything will work out fine. Don't worry that you haven't prepared enough. Give yourself a break and relax.",Virgo
"Dec 26, 2022 - Come down from the clouds today, Virgo. It's important to connect with what's going on down here. It could be that you're missing your target because you failed to take certain details into account that are obvious to everyone else. Attend to projects that require your attention. Realistic planning and disciplined actions are the best activities to engage in.",Virgo
"Dec 27, 2022 - Virgo, you may have felt as if something has been changing in your family environment over the last few weeks. Today you will find out what's been going on. Someone close to you has been going through some important changes in his or her life. You feel as if you need to be there and accompany this person on a journey of self-development.",Virgo
"Dec 28, 2022 - You're often like a Zen master who doesn't say anything to pupils for months, until the day the pupils begin to not believe any more and find themselves growing indifferent to the whole thing. Then the master pronounces one or two phrases that are so incredibly true that no one knows what to say! You could be that Zen master today.",Virgo
"Dec 29, 2022 - The events of the day depend on your ability to put things into question today, Virgo. In general, you're good at analyzing situations when things aren't going well in your relationships. Now someone in your family may have a problem acting responsibly. It's up to that person to take care of things, but you could understand the message the person is trying to send other people with his or her behavior.",Virgo
"Dec 30, 2022 - Other people may tend to snap under the emotional pressure of the day, Virgo, but you're well suited to soar through with flying colors. You're ruled by your emotions and you have no problem navigating rough waters. Other people may look to you for strength and support. Trust yourself and try not to get lured off course by conflicting opinions that don't seem to sit right with you.",Virgo
"Dec 31, 2022 - This is an excellent day for you, Virgo. You will find that things automatically flow your way. You will receive more attention than usual and be the center of any flattering discussions. The one difficult point might be intimate relations with others. Romantic issues may take on a more serious, grounded tone at this time.",Virgo
"Feb 4, 2023 - Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Libra. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra

It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra
"Feb 4, 2022 - Don't hesitate when it comes to taking on a project or making plans today, Libra. Extra energy will complement your organizational skills, making the perfect combination to handle almost anything. Be sure to write down your goals and plans to help keep you focused. If you decide to tackle any cleaning today, get rid of the things you never use. Consider donating such items to charity, since there's undoubtedly someone out there who could use them.",Libra
"Feb 5, 2022 - Today you may want to go your own way regardless of what someone else wants, Libra. Your independence is very important to you. However, compromise might be necessary in order to avoid serious conflict. Consider splitting your day to allow for the wishes of those close to you and time for yourself. If you can't make others understand why you want to be alone, this might be the best solution.",Libra
"Feb 6, 2022 - It's a good day to pull out that shopping list, Libra. Your ability to be thrifty and efficient will be strengthened at this time, so why not take advantage of it? Take a few minutes to look through recent flyers or gather coupons before heading out. And if you find yourself feeling tempted to spend your savings on something lavish, get back to your list! Keep your budget in the forefront of your mind and head straight to the checkout when you're done.",Libra
"Feb 7, 2022 - Today is an excellent day to set some new goals, Libra. When was the last time you did this? Many think that New Year's Day and birthdays are prime times to make resolutions or set goals, yet this is something that can be done any time. In fact, it's advisable to renew, rename, and revamp ambitions on a regular basis, since life brings constant change to circumstances. Pull out some paper and jot your ideas down.",Libra
"Feb 8, 2022 - It's a great day to set some of your ideas into motion, Libra. The courage you need to forge ahead is available to you with this day's planetary aspects. All you need to do is use it. If your thoughts aren't clear, sit down and write your ideas out. Note the steps you need to take in order to get things rolling and then make your move. Don't let fear or insecurity hold you back!",Libra
"Feb 9, 2022 - Today you should feel more energetic, enthusiastic, and motivated than you have in a long time, Libra. You feel very optimistic about your future, thanks to recent successes and support from those closest to you. As a result, your intellectual and creative faculties are more than inspired enough to move forward. The only downside is that there could be so many ideas coming to you that you might not be able to choose among them. Think about each one carefully before going ahead.",Libra
"Feb 10, 2022 - A chance to take a long journey, perhaps to a distant state or foreign country, could suddenly present itself to you today, Libra. This trip is apt to be far more significant than a simple vacation. It may be career related or involve an opportunity to expand your education. It could also concern a relationship. Whichever it is, you're likely to make the trip and it will probably change your life in subtle ways.",Libra
"Feb 11, 2022 - A rush of excess ambition could cause you to channel a lot of your physical and mental energy into whatever work you're doing right now, Libra. This might involve writing, teaching, or speaking in some way. As a result of your zeal, your body could be exhausted but your mind spinning like a top, even though the thoughts coming up may be scattered. It might be best to pace yourself now more than you're inclined to. Stay focused!",Libra
"Feb 12, 2022 - You may feel a bit of restriction working to hold you back from your current plans today, Libra. It could be that your mind is feeling restless and that you’re anxious to go, but there’s a feeling of discipline and caution nagging you and urging you to slow down. This might not be a bad idea. Discipline and willpower may be exactly the things you need in order to get where you’re going.",Libra
"Feb 13, 2022 - Weirdness is the keyword for today, Libra. You could be flooded with information from newspapers or the Internet that seems very strange to you. There's a reason for this. It's very likely to be misinformation! Don't be afraid to take it with a grain of salt, even though others take it very seriously. Hang on to your skepticism, and don't pass the information on unless you preface it with your honest opinion.",Libra
"Feb 14, 2022 - Success in business, perhaps involving writing or speaking, might come your way today, Libra. Paperwork, such as contracts, could take up a lot of your time. You might also have to spend a lot of time on the phone or in the car. All this activity could have you feeling a bit frazzled. Nonetheless, you're going to feel very enthusiastic and optimistic about everything that's happening, and you should look forward to future enterprises. Enjoy!",Libra
"Feb 15, 2022 - This should be one of those days when you feel as if you could conquer the world. You feel strong and determined, Libra, and willing to do whatever it takes to get wherever you want to be. A goal could be attained at this time, ambitions realized, or perhaps a lucky break could come your way. This is an excellent day to seek a new job, ask for a raise, or make a favorite project a success.",Libra
"Feb 16, 2022 - Today you’re likely to feel torn in two different directions, Libra. A part of you could want to sequester yourself somewhere and read, while another part of you feels that you should get out, go somewhere, and do something. You may be more impatient than usual with squabbles between colleagues or family members. It might be a good idea to do some exercise during the day to work off the inner tensions. Relax with a good book in the evening!",Libra
"Feb 17, 2022 - Your imagination is flying high today, Libra. Your interest in mystical and metaphysical matters is at an all-time high, and you could find yourself strolling through New Age bookstores. Travel to distant places may seem especially appealing, and you might dream of flying to India, Israel, Egypt, or Ireland. This is all wonderful as long as you stay grounded. Plan a trip if you can. Join a meditation group. Go with the flow!",Libra
"Feb 18, 2022 - Your home could be a very busy place today, Libra. Visitors could come and go throughout the day, probably annoying you at times. You might also find yourself having to soothe angry outbursts on the part of a member of your household. Take care, however, that this person's problem doesn't get you so inflamed that you go into a fit of anger, too. Try to stay calm and focused and you'll get through the day.",Libra
"Feb 19, 2022 - Generally, you tend to be a very physically oriented person, Libra, but today you’re more likely to want to look within, perhaps to experiment with your own psychic abilities or study spiritual concepts. You also might find yourself more interested than usual in the arts, particularly that which comes from other cultures. You'll be far more contemplative today than usual. It might prove enlightening to write down your thoughts.",Libra
"Feb 20, 2022 - Your creative talents could seem totally blocked today, Libra. You may have a project you really want to work on. You have the mental focus, but the creative element just might not be there. This could prove so frustrating that you want to throw something. Do this if you must (preferably a pillow). Still, the only answer might be to shelve your work until tomorrow. You should be back to normal by then.",Libra
"Feb 21, 2022 - There’s no question about it, Libra, you’ve been working hard these last few weeks. As an approaching deadline looms, you may find yourself waking up at night, running numbers through your head, and mentally rewriting project proposals. It's exhausting, to be sure, but know that the end result will make all this aggravation worthwhile.",Libra
"Feb 22, 2022 - You’re likely to be feeling the tug of distant lands, Libra. Today you could stop at the travel agent’s office, the one you've walked by countless times, and stare at the pictures. Thailand, Hong Kong, and New Zealand are just a few of the places you'd like to see. The pictures look so enticing. Go ahead. Plan such a trip, although it’s likely to be only a temporary diversion. Your wanderlust indicates a fundamental restlessness that must be resolved.",Libra
"Feb 23, 2022 - Gloom may settle upon you today when you face your financial situation, Libra. You may have had a lot of bills to pay, and thus your coffers could be a bit low for your liking. Still, this is only temporary, and it probably feels good to have the bills out of the way. Find something inexpensive, like reading, to keep you busy and get your mind off it. You're probably doing fine!",Libra
"Feb 24, 2022 - Your natural intuition and sensitivity will be heightened today, Libra. You’re able to read the thoughts and feelings of others and interpret them accurately. Alas, you can’t use this skill as effectively on yourself. Some old issues have reemerged, causing you some distress. These issues are blocking you in some way. You won’t be able to move forward with your life until you resolve them once and for all. Perhaps a professional psychic could help.",Libra
"Feb 25, 2022 - While your enthusiasm is high, your resistance may be a bit low, Libra. Take extra good care of yourself during this busy time. Your tendency is to overdo things, attending too many parties and shopping until the stores close. Your social life is in high gear right now, but you'll have to allow yourself some time to rest if you're going to have any hope of enjoying it.",Libra
"Feb 26, 2022 - Some bad news about your financial situation may not really be as bad as it first appears. Even so, it throws you for a loop. Double-check the information before spiraling into a panic, Libra. It may be that a computer made an error or a bank clerk messed up. You may have to unravel some paperwork, but it will be a relief to have it resolved.",Libra
"Feb 27, 2022 - If you're taking a trip any time soon, Libra, you can expect to experience a powerful attraction for someone you meet along the way. This will definitely make your journey more interesting; however, the friendship might not survive the trip. You may be from opposite sides of the country, and one or both of you could be involved with other people. Nonetheless, if neither of those restrictions applies, it's worth pursuing. Go for it!",Libra
"Feb 28, 2022 - This is unlike you, Libra, but today you're a lean, mean cleaning machine. You get it in your head that this is the day for putting your house in order, and you set about single-handedly doing it. That's way too much cleaning and organizing for one person to do. Why not enlist some help? Bribe your partner or kids, play some loud music, and all of you will finish the tasks in no time.",Libra
"Feb 4, 2023 - Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Libra. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra

It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra
"Mar 1, 2022 - Worries about money could be uppermost in your mind today, Libra. You may have suffered some financial setbacks and wonder how you can muster enough funds to get over the hump. However, help is on the way. An outside source could provide funds to tide you over. Whatever other problems you may have will all be straightened out later. Your own ingenuity and a little help from your friends will probably see you through.",Libra
"Mar 2, 2022 - This could very well be one of those days in which you forget to put on your shoes before heading out the door, Libra. Make sure your head is screwed on tight before you climb out of bed this morning; otherwise you might find it floating up in the clouds. Daydreams will seep into your consciousness no matter how hard you try to keep your mind focused on the matter at hand.",Libra
"Mar 3, 2022 - The rapid level of growth that you've probably been experiencing could suddenly prove too much for you today, Libra. You might need to take a little breather to grasp what's happening in your life. New friends, new knowledge, and new opportunities have appeared in profusion, but you could still be feeling a bit down, wondering if you can handle it all. Don't fight these feelings; work through them instead. You'll be better off for it.",Libra
"Mar 4, 2022 - Today should find you continuing to work toward cherished career and other goals. Love matters may come to the forefront, Libra. If you're currently involved, unexpected events could bring you that much closer to your partner. If you aren't involved, you could meet someone exciting, perhaps through some kind of group activities. Also, a longtime friend could suddenly appear to you in a new light. Whichever it is, expect some interesting developments.",Libra
"Mar 5, 2022 - The surge of power within you is going to let others know that you mean business, Libra. Make good use of this fantastic boost of energy by conquering your own goals and demons instead of using it to wage war on anyone else. Other people should know to get out of your way when you have your mind set on doing something. If they don't, politely ask them to move instead of steamrolling over them.",Libra
"Mar 6, 2022 - This is meant to be a nice, relaxing day, so treat it as such, Libra. There's no need for you to plan any great strategy at this time. Try to take it easy and not indulge in any unnecessary stress. This is your time to enjoy the moment. Don't tax your mind by overanalyzing everything that comes your way. Go with the flow and have a great time regardless of what you end up doing.",Libra
"Mar 7, 2022 - While your brain may want to charge ahead with new and revolutionary ideas, there is something holding you back from setting these ideas into motion, Libra. It could be that there is a small voice in your head telling you to slow down and not automatically accept things and adopt them into your life just because they're new. Do your best to strike a balance between these two viewpoints.",Libra
"Mar 8, 2022 - Even if you aren't romantically involved, Libra, you're likely to feel especially passionate today and anxious to schedule an intimate evening with someone who's caught your eye. You may not gallop off into the sunset right away, but you could dream of faraway lands. You might want to plan a trip. Be patient and don't overwhelm this person with too much passion too soon. Wait and see how things go.",Libra
"Mar 9, 2022 - Today is one of those days in which you might be kicking yourself for not telling the truth on an earlier occasion, Libra. The words that seemed so harmless then may come back to haunt you now. Today is a very action-oriented day. Conflict could arise because what was thought to be true then now turns out to be false and counter to the action being taken at this time.",Libra
"Mar 10, 2022 - There is a strong wave of power coming your way, so be careful how you handle it, Libra. You're extra prone to injuries and accidents of an explosive nature. Try not to make any hasty moves while driving, and be careful operating things like gas pumps or propane tanks. Used properly, today's planetary energy can help you tackle just about any obstacle in front of you. How you handle the energy is up to you.",Libra
"Mar 11, 2022 - Show some gratitude to the people around you today, Libra. The seat of your personality is very strong at this time, and you're confident to your core. Mix this feeling with the service-oriented sensitivity of the day that asks us to do things for others. Keep in mind that a gesture as simple as a smile and word of appreciation can be healing for another person - and you.",Libra
"Mar 12, 2022 - You have a great deal of power at your disposal today, Libra. You should keep in mind that just about anything you wish for will come true. Don't waste words or actions. Concentrate your energy and focus it on one or two important things instead of dispersing it and thereby diluting your overall power. There isn't anything to fear on a day like this.",Libra
"Mar 13, 2022 - Congratulations, Libra! You've finally reached a goal you've been working toward for a long time. Success and advancement are on their way, and you should be feeling extremely enthusiastic and optimistic about your future. Some vast changes may take place in your life, but they all promise to be positive. Expect to travel and learn a lot. Make the most of these energies.",Libra
"Mar 14, 2022 - Yikes! What an emotional day, Libra. The planetary energies are forecasting conflict, and lots of it. Do your best to personally steer clear of any of it, and try to avoid being drawn into any arguments. You may wish to keep to yourself today. Tonight either stay in or head out to the movies alone. Don't worry, everyone will be feeling much better tomorrow.",Libra
"Mar 15, 2022 - You may get a chance to make some extra money today, perhaps by working overtime. However, this might interfere with a social event that you've committed to, and could cause disappointment among your friends and family members. It could also give rise to a little trouble with your partner. However, remind yourself that this disappointment will pass, and the money will be more than welcome. Hang in there!",Libra
"Mar 16, 2022 - You may find it hard to connect with your emotions today, Libra. It could be that it's difficult to find a bit of quiet time when you can really sit down and listen to your inner voice. There are distractions all around that are pulling you in many different directions. Keep in mind that these forces aren't necessarily acting in your best interests.",Libra
"Mar 17, 2022 - Career matters are at the forefront of your concerns today, Libra. Opportunities for advancement may suddenly appear that you weren't aware of yesterday, and you'll need to make snap decisions and go for what you want right away. Don't be surprised if someone you'd nearly forgotten about is of great help today. The presence of people dear to you is going to be significant.",Libra
"Mar 18, 2022 - The energy of the day is electric, and you could find yourself bouncing from task to task and person to person, Libra. Things are apt to happen when you least expect them, so be prepared for surprises. There's an element of genius to the day that might inspire you to be someone much greater than you ever thought you could be. Join with people who share your same zest for life.",Libra
"Mar 19, 2022 - Money could be a source of worry today, Libra. You might feel you've spent too much (who doesn't sometimes?) or perhaps some funds you were expecting have been held up. This is a delay and not a permanent situation (although it might seem that way). Too much worry could spoil your day, and you don't want that. If there's anything you can do to ease the situation, do it. Otherwise, hang in there.",Libra
"Mar 20, 2022 - Travel and adventure are on your mind. You could be daydreaming about flying to exotic places and doing unusual things, such as touring the ancient sights of India or going on safari in Kenya. Such dreams are possible, Libra, so you might want to look into it. You also might want to learn about exciting fields of interest, so this is a good day to sign up for a class or workshop.",Libra
"Mar 21, 2022 - Today you might be feeling a very powerful and all-consuming love for everyone around you, and perhaps for all life forms in general. You're also likely to be feeling romantic, passionate, and anxious for the company of a love partner. Your imagination is flying high, Libra, and you could be trying to find a gift for a loved one. You're also feeling very spiritually inclined.",Libra
"Mar 22, 2022 - Your hard work on the job may appear to be finally paying off, Libra, as all signs indicate that a raise, promotion, or other form of advancement is coming your way. Your ambition and concentration have led and will continue to lead to significant accomplishment, which isn't likely to escape the notice of those above you in the hierarchy. Draw satisfaction from your achievements and continue as you are.",Libra
"Mar 23, 2022 - Spiritual occurrences could lead to a very powerful healing experience, Libra. Repressed past traumas could come to the surface and be processed and released. This could leave you feeling rather dazed, as this purging could open a gap in your psyche. Don't worry; eventually it will fill with new knowledge and insights instead of psychic garbage! For now, take a walk. It will clear your head and help you deal with it all.",Libra
"Mar 24, 2022 - This isn't the day to take care of paperwork, Libra, particularly if it involves money. Your mental processes are slower than usual, and you may find that you're easily distracted. Your mood won't be all that great either, so it might be a good idea to wait a few days before tackling tasks like this. If the work is urgent, ask for help. You'll be able to stay more focused if you do.",Libra
"Mar 25, 2022 - Your mind is probably taking a mystical turn, Libra. This is a great day to study spiritual or metaphysical concepts or expand your knowledge of fields like astrology, numerology, or the other occult sciences. Books and lectures may come to your attention, and discussions with friends who share your interests should set your mind going. Don't let today pass you by. Expand your mind.",Libra
"Mar 26, 2022 - You have a warm and sensitive nature, Libra, and today you could be feeling especially tuned in to the feelings of others. Romance is very much on your mind, as are all things sensual. If you're shopping for clothes, you'll likely be drawn to rich and luxurious fabrics. Don't hesitate to indulge this passionate side of yourself. Your mate will likely be quite appreciative!",Libra
"Mar 27, 2022 - Love certainly seems to make the world go round today, Libra. Is everyone around you deeply involved in a new or revitalized romance? You may be smitten with a very exciting person, perhaps from a foreign country or in the field of law, education, or publishing. Don't fight it, and don't worry about getting hurt. Relax and let yourself be loved. If nothing else, you should have a wonderful day!",Libra
"Mar 28, 2022 - Corporate kudos and increased income that you may have been working toward for a long time may finally manifest today, Libra. Your effort and energy haven't gone unnoticed. What you're doing now has impressed those in a position to advance your interests. Positive changes in your career situation could well take place, even if what you've been wanting is a whole new career. Congratulations! Keep up the good work.",Libra
"Mar 29, 2022 - Developments over the past few days could have you feeling very excited and particularly optimistic about your love life, Libra. Communications with your beloved could take the form of romantic songs or poetry. If you want to give your friend a gift, by all means do, but confine it to something nonthreatening like a book. Everything seems great now, but too much emotional expression and material generosity could overwhelm your friend. Be patient!",Libra
"Mar 30, 2022 - Love matters could have you feeling uptight and somewhat fearful today, Libra. Perhaps this involves a relationship that hasn't really manifested yet, or maybe you and your beloved have had a dispute of some kind. Don't worry too much. You should hear some reassuring words before too long. Try to stay calm when talking to your partner. Sounding desperate or scared could push him or her in the opposite direction.",Libra
"Mar 31, 2022 - Have you been planning a vacation to a distant place, Libra? Unexpected, discouraging glitches could interfere with your plans, which could have you thinking that you'll just cancel the trip. You might be tempted to pick up the phone and do it. Take no action today. The entire situation should be straightened out by tomorrow, and you'll look forward to your trip again. Stay focused and don't do anything rash.",Libra
"Apr 1, 2022 - You could be thinking some bizarre thoughts today, Libra. They might lead you in a direction that doesn't quite pertain to your current situation. Don't be afraid to explore these strange realms, because they could give you some important insight that you wouldn't have realized otherwise. Wisdom can be found in the unlikeliest of places, so don't discount something because it seems a bit off the wall at first.",Libra
"Apr 2, 2022 - If you have the opportunity to teach someone a lesson, Libra, feel free to do so. There's probably someone in your world who could use a bit of instruction now. You'll have the patience and clarity of words to straighten things out and make the correct path obvious. Don't be stingy with your knowledge. The situation will improve for you and everyone else when you selflessly spread your wisdom to others.",Libra
"Apr 3, 2022 - You're anxious to make a bold move toward the love of your life, Libra. Love and romance are most certainly in your favor right now. It isn't surprising that you feel brave. Be careful, however, about getting so carried away with your self-assurance that you distort the truth of the situation. There's an element of fantasy operating that's making it difficult for you to see the whole picture.",Libra
"Apr 4, 2022 - For a few weeks now you've understood that each day brings its share of constraints, Libra. For example, today you could feel doubts about your physical appearance. Are you questioning your attractiveness or your ability to make an impression on someone special? Did you use bad judgment at some point, and you're now afraid that you've hurt your reputation? A decision you make at the end of the day will relieve these anxieties.",Libra
"Apr 5, 2022 - This is the ideal moment to address once and for all the questions that have been on your mind for the last three weeks, Libra. Pay particular attention to questions that touch on your sentimental side. If you're currently involved in unsatisfactory relationships, don't be afraid to leave them behind. And if you're fretting about a request you made that has yet to be answered, let it go. No response is forthcoming.",Libra
"Apr 6, 2022 - Some rather upsetting news about a friend could come to you today, Libra, probably over the phone. This could be the truth, but more likely the facts have been distorted in the retelling. In fact, what you're hearing may actually be nothing more than gossip. Phone someone who might know what's really going on, preferably the friend you heard about, and check the facts before driving yourself crazy.",Libra
"Apr 7, 2022 - A social event could bring you into contact with a very intense, fascinating person in an intriguing profession, Libra. You could find him or her very charming and sexy. If you aren't romantically involved at the moment, there could be potential here! If nothing else, this person might steer you in a new intellectual or spiritual direction. You could seem somewhat transformed when you leave the party tonight.",Libra
"Apr 8, 2022 - Overindulgence in food and drink over the past few days could be causing you to feel a little out of sorts today, Libra. You might even wonder if the fun was worth it! A little careful attention to yourself will have you back to normal in no time. Don't be surprised, however, if another opportunity to live it up presents itself! Take care. You don't want to feel this way again.",Libra
"Apr 9, 2022 - This might prove to be one of those days in which it's very hard to get anything related to work or communication off the ground, Libra. You could find excuses to stop working more often than usual, particularly if it involves calling people on the phone. Don't fight it. Take care of the most urgent tasks. The world won't come to an end if you put the rest off a while.",Libra
"Apr 10, 2022 - Communication of all sorts could be vital to you today, Libra. You might spend much of the day on the phone organizing an important event or perhaps clearing up a misunderstanding. This could make it a rather stressful day. It might be one of those days you just need to get through. Give yourself a bit of solitary downtime tonight to counterbalance the busy energy of the day.",Libra
"Apr 11, 2022 - Communication with friends, siblings, and neighbors should be open, congenial, and supportive today, Libra. A gathering could open the door to new friendships, interesting discussions, and other group activities that you might enjoy. The only downside could involve mental overload. You might learn so much today that you can't keep track of it all. Take notes so you can maintain a record of everything that particularly impresses you.",Libra
"Apr 12, 2022 - You should make an effort to be patient and tolerant, especially at the office, even though you might not feel like it, Libra. You'll likely take a lot of deep breaths as projects get delayed and meetings drag on. There isn't much you can do about it. Stay focused and trust that everything will be resolved by day's end. In the meantime, don't step on anyone's toes. Your colleagues' nerves are raw.",Libra
"Apr 13, 2022 - Sex and romance should be at the top of your priority list today, Libra. You should be feeling especially warm, loving, and passionate. Romantic novels and movies could be especially appealing, as could an intimate evening with a lover! Career and money matters look fairly strong and stable at this time, although it might take a little effort to keep them that way. Go for the gold!",Libra
"Apr 14, 2022 - You're going to be busy but happy today, Libra. It's likely that a project you've been working on for a long time suddenly yields positive results. You can't help but be delighted, as this achievement comes at a time when you've been questioning your abilities. Question no more. It's clear that you're right for this particular job. Social activities are also highlighted, so treat your team to lunch to celebrate.",Libra
"Apr 15, 2022 - Tugs on the home front could be pulling you away from attending an event with friends that you've been looking forward to for some time. Try to be reasonable and sort out the needs of those at home with kindness in your heart. You might be able to address those issues and still have time to be with your friends later. Just remember to keep your priorities straight, Libra.",Libra
"Apr 16, 2022 - This is one day for you to be as flexible as possible, Libra. It may be that you begin with a specific list of items that absolutely must be done, but get distracted by some news from a friend or co-worker. What had seemed so important is no longer so, and your day shifts to accommodate this new piece of information. You'll be rather surprised by but no less satisfied with how the day turns out.",Libra
"Apr 17, 2022 - You have much to be grateful for, Libra. Why not go out tonight and celebrate with friends? Forget about work and family troubles and kick up your heels. Have a high old time. You deserve the break. If you don't seize these moments when you have the opportunity, you risk becoming a single-minded individual who thinks only of work at the expense of life's other great pleasures.",Libra
"Apr 18, 2022 - You've been working hard lately and deserve the professional acclaim that comes your way, Libra. As a result of your efforts, it's likely you've received or will soon receive a bonus, raise, or promotion of some kind. Celebrate, but just one night. If you let the party continue indefinitely, the bill could be too large even for you! Be frugal and work hard. That's your real ticket to the good life.",Libra
"Apr 19, 2022 - This is going to be one of those days when you get annoyed if someone takes too long to make up his or her mind about something, Libra. You aren't going to have the patience to abide anyone who continues to go over every single detail of an issue. You're more likely to want to simply make a decision, for better or worse.",Libra
"Apr 20, 2022 - The atmosphere around you could seem somewhat unreal today. If you get a weird vibe from someone, Libra, take everything this person says with a grain of salt. He or she has an agenda and isn't above distorting the truth to achieve it. If what they say doesn't affect you, don't worry about it. If it does, take pains to learn the facts before acting on it. You'll be glad you did.",Libra
"Apr 21, 2022 - Expect to exchange a lot of phone calls and emails with friends today, Libra. Communication with others is your top priority. You have a lot of news to deliver and you'll receive a lot in return. Much of what you hear could be useful for whatever you're involved with now. The only downside is mental overload. You could feel as if your brain has spent the day running a marathon.",Libra
"Apr 22, 2022 - Your desire to respect and honor the special someone in your life clashes today with an equally strong desire to become a passionate persuader, Libra. The secret to resolving this conflict lies in knowing that the two aren't mutually exclusive. Also, if you're going to make the most of both drives, you need to tune in to your partner's thoughts and feelings. Zero in on what you both want and then go for it! Enjoy your day.",Libra
"Apr 23, 2022 - This would be a good day to putter about the house, Libra. It isn't a good day to travel or begin any major projects. This could be just the excuse you've needed for taking a day off from your life! You need not answer the phone or fulfill any obligations whatsoever. Simply stay put and tackle some minor household chores. If even that proves too much, then curl up with some tea and a good book.",Libra
"Apr 24, 2022 - Things aren't always as they first appear. People you thought you knew well and circumstances that you thought you understood thoroughly now seem anything but straightforward. Has the world really changed that much or has your perception altered somehow? It's time to direct this “altered” vision inward. You're ready for a change, Libra. Perhaps it's time to dust off that resume.",Libra
"Apr 25, 2022 - One couldn't really say that you have a hard time making decisions regarding your love life, Libra. You're a passionate person and you believe in love at first sight. You're probably the most spontaneous lover in your immediate circle! Add to that, you're entering a period in which your emotions will be heightened. All the elements are there to ignite your creativity in every aspect of your life.",Libra
"Apr 26, 2022 - You're looking beautiful and feeling passionate, Libra. If only your passions could be reciprocated! Even though there may not be anyone special in your life right now, that's no reason to not treat yourself well. Go out for a nice meal or, better yet, order take-out and dine at home, complete with music, candles, and your finest china. You should appreciate yourself even if no one else does at the moment.",Libra
"Apr 27, 2022 - Some disturbing dreams could bring up doubts you may have about the motives of someone you consider a friend, Libra. This person might have been acting strangely, and you could be wondering about the future of your friendship. It's important to look at the symbols in the dreams and try to analyze what they're telling you. They might be indicating your friend, you, or both. Think about it!",Libra
"Apr 28, 2022 - Today your relationships with just about everyone - friends, relatives, colleagues, and romantic partners - should be going very well, Libra. Your communication is good, and your ability to see the other person's point of view is clearer than usual. This might be a bit disconcerting, as it could conflict with your viewpoint, but bear in mind you don't have to agree with others to learn from them. Enjoy your day.",Libra
"Apr 29, 2022 - Memories and emotions welling up from the past might excite your creative impulses today, Libra. You may not quite be able to understand what all of this means, but the pictures should keep coming to you nonetheless. It might be a good idea to take some notes, even though you might not comprehend all you write. This may be more a process of releasing ancient traumas than creating great masterpieces, but even so, it's worth pursuing.",Libra
"Apr 30, 2022 - Today the celestial energy will be trying to teach you something, Libra, specifically, how to share with others. But first you must get to a place where you truly want to share something of yourself. Have you examined your tendency to run away? You seem to be afraid that they'll overwhelm you or that you'll owe them something. This isn't the case, Libra. Why not give other people a chance to get to know you?",Libra
"Feb 4, 2023 - Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Libra. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra
"May 1, 2022 - Are you getting hit with obstacles, Libra? Could it be that you simply need to allot yourself more time to complete the monumental tasks you take on? This might be difficult for you to tolerate. You don't know how to deal with times like these when you must continue doing the same thing over and over until you get results. There's a lesson here for you. Remember that patience is a virtue.",Libra
"May 2, 2022 - When you talk, you want other people to listen, Libra. More than likely, your thoughts will drift toward humanitarian ideas and philosophies. You're eager to share your ideas with others, and you may have a utopian dream that, if everyone just followed, would make the world a much better place. People may make fun of you for having such a perspective, but this definitely doesn't mean that you should stop dreaming.",Libra
"May 3, 2022 - You have a rather strange day in front of you, Libra. The celestial atmosphere could be playing tricks on you. You might get aggravated for no reason at all, that is, unless it's because you've been meeting too many people who don't appreciate the original way you go about doing things. You may feel as if you live in a world full of dinosaurs. Don't give up yet!",Libra
"May 4, 2022 - Gloom over money matters might catch up with you at some point today, Libra. However, there's nothing really major to worry about. Financially, your business affairs should be going well, so you're probably doing better than you think. A little caution might be in order, especially regarding impulse buying or purchasing luxuries. You don't want to end up having to take items back to the store.",Libra
"May 5, 2022 - Although your mind may have been a bit clouded over the past few days, today the fog should clear and you'll feel more focused. Money matters might need some attention, Libra, and you're in just the right space to dig in and take care of them. Once practical matters are settled, however, this is a great day for spiritual studies or meditation. Creative projects can also benefit from your increased concentration.",Libra
"May 6, 2022 - You're now in a terrific position to make a significant move in your life, Libra. With a great deal of physical energy coupled with incredibly high self-esteem, you have what it takes to make a major push toward larger goals. There's opportunity coming at you from all angles, and the energy at hand is fast and furious. Your strong, courageous nature is ripe for hopping aboard when that train comes zooming by.",Libra
"May 7, 2022 - You need to slow down in matters of love and romance, Libra. You're likely acting on the assumption that things are fine and you can continue moving at lightning speed even though you long ago lost your road map. There's a degree of fantasy in your world. It doesn't take into account the fact that there are areas where you need to be more sensitive to your partner and perhaps take things more slowly and methodically.",Libra
"May 8, 2022 - You have a lot of thinking to do about your professional goals, Libra. You'll go over the elements to see if there isn't some way to approach things differently. Are there new paths you could try or ways to improve things? Your mind will go a thousand miles a minute today. Those who spend time with you may be totally exhausted by the end of the day because of all the questions you ask!",Libra
"May 9, 2022 - At last, a day of relief from the tension! The flow of communication facilitates personal and professional projects. Now is the time to listen to your partner or other family members about the material aspects of the future. For example, are you setting aside enough money for your children's education? Are you taking proper care of your home? Are your investments allocated correctly? These are all issues worth considering today.",Libra
"May 10, 2022 - You must have felt the pressure rising in the past week. Intense, isn't it? Do you have a job to finish at the last minute? Is there some ill humor or misunderstanding among your relations? Are you dissatisfied with yourself? Today you can make a fresh start, complete with good resolutions. You thought you'd worked hard enough, but guess what? The task is only beginning!",Libra
"May 11, 2022 - The little fighter that you are makes it very difficult for you to join us in the great communal river that we're all trying to navigate, Libra. You prefer to travel solo, going down your private stream as you see fit. However, these are opportune days to try joining up with others. Some events may occur to remind you of the benefits of community.",Libra
"May 12, 2022 - An exciting new project or opportunity could be presented to you today, Libra. It could involve a new love or at least a new friend. Something you've been working on for a long time could finally come to fruition. It will stir your enthusiasm for moving on to the next project! What are you waiting for?",Libra
"May 13, 2022 - The celestial energy signals a pleasant change for you today, Libra. Finally, the overpowering emotions that have been surging from your relationships will subside. You are now beginning a more contemplative phase. You may feel as if you're about to depart on a long trip, with all the time in the world to meditate on the events of the past few months.",Libra
"May 14, 2022 - A small crisis is still a crisis, isn't it, Libra? Expect one in your personal life today. Since you aren't one to let issues go unresolved, you won't be able to put off dealing with your problems any longer. Questions abound. Are work and responsibilities shared equally with your partner? Are you both making an equal effort to maintain relationship harmony? Asking the questions is the first step to answering them.",Libra
"May 15, 2022 - Libra, this is an ideal moment to address once and for all the questions that have been on your mind for the last few weeks. Pay particular attention to questions that touch on your sentimental life. If you're currently involved in unsatisfactory relationships, don't be afraid to leave them behind. If you're fretting about an unanswered request, let it go. No response is forthcoming.",Libra
"May 16, 2022 - You may feel rather lazy and out of touch today, Libra. It could be that your emotions have taken a stronger hold on your psyche than your rational way of thinking. Therefore, making decisions might be quite difficult. In matters of the heart, you could feel a bit more romantic than usual. There is a great sentimental mood to the day that's causing you to empathize with others.",Libra
"May 17, 2022 - Sometimes people might reproach you for being less than tactful in relationships, Libra. However, today's planetary energies are going to help you be more sensitive. You'll feel as though you suddenly have a much greater capacity for listening. Whether it's true or not, others will have the impression that you are no longer so self-centered.",Libra
"May 18, 2022 - Having a personal opinion on any question isn't the most difficult thing in the world to do, Libra. More difficult is confronting with some objectivity the opinions of others. The current celestial energy is marking a change toward a mindset that is more scientifically oriented. This is no longer the moment to affirm yourself but rather to learn from others.",Libra
"May 19, 2022 - There's a solid grounding to the day that might have you feeling less than energetic about getting the ball rolling, Libra. Don't be surprised if there's a sense of restriction and duty weighing you down. Times of rest and reflection are very important in the natural cycle. Don't think that you always need to be on the go in order to make progress. Put your warring nature aside today and rest.",Libra
"May 20, 2022 - The intensity of the day could work for you in one of two ways, Libra. You can either be depressed and weighed down by the intense emotionalism that's likely to well up, or you can take this incredible intensity and put it to good use. The choice is yours. Realize that any action you take is going to be highly charged with feelings. Likewise, others will be extra sensitive about any move you make.",Libra
"May 21, 2022 - You can expect to be more and more interested in new technologies these days, Libra. What you once considered very progressive now seems much closer to reality. You'll notice to what an extent it is now crucial for you to align yourself with the cutting-edge technology that surrounds you. Don't hesitate. You are by definition a pioneer, so full speed ahead to these new frontiers!",Libra
"May 22, 2022 - Secure your bunker and make sure it's fully stocked with heavy artillery, because there is bound to be a battle, Libra. Trust that you need to be fully prepared in order to enter the fight today, because you do. There are some battles that you actually like - the ones that get things rolling and produce results. It will soon become clear which type this is.",Libra
"May 23, 2022 - Watch out for a little jolt in the action as someone close to you puts on the brakes in your relationship, Libra. Conflicts could arise based on a need for more structure and stability. The imbalance between having fun and taking care of practical matters is working to slowly destroy the good thing that you have going. Nip this problem in the bud as soon as possible.",Libra
"May 24, 2022 - This is going to be a good day to see the doctor, Libra, but not because you're sick. The atmosphere is ideal for getting a checkup. You've been using a lot of energy recently, and you'd be well advised to take care of your body a bit more right now. Don't be lazy about this. Get up, eat a good breakfast, take a brisk walk, and face the day renewed.",Libra
"May 25, 2022 - Your thinking is steady and reserved today, Libra. You'll find that your mind is right in line with your ego, and you'll be able to accurately verbalize what's going on inside. You might be guarded about how much you tell people. It could be that others are holding back information from you. Proceed with caution and be honest in all your dealings.",Libra
"May 26, 2022 - Long-term projects that you've been working on are apt to shift into forward gear today, Libra. This change may be subtle, but it's quite powerful and extremely helpful to whatever it is you have going. Dreams that may have seemed difficult to achieve now have more of a chance to actually manifest. You should take this opportunity to reset your dials and make big plans for your ideal future.",Libra
"May 27, 2022 - Any argument you start today is likely to erupt into a brutal emotional battle, Libra, so beware. Try not to tread on anyone else's turf, because you'll find that he or she is likely to be possessive and rather belligerent about defending what is rightfully theirs. Avoid volcanic eruptions of energy. Don't pick fights where they aren't needed. You can civilly resolve issues without doing harm to others.",Libra
"May 28, 2022 - The gentle winds of change are blowing through your life at the moment, Libra. You have a feeling of newness and an open attitude toward the world. Some outside events will be coming up in your life that give you the impression you're advancing in a concrete manner toward a new life. You can expect to have some pleasant surprises.",Libra
"May 29, 2022 - Tap into the electrifying energy of a day that encourages safe, appropriate social interactions and activities, Libra. You'll find plenty of oxygen to keep your internal fire raging. Take the lead and others will follow eagerly. The chords struck within you today will surely resonate with larger plans that you've been secretly brewing in the back of your mind for some time now.",Libra
"May 30, 2022 - It's important for you to be extra cautious today, Libra. If you absolutely must go out, make sure you're calm and collected before getting behind the wheel of a car. Don't forget that helmet if you're riding your bike. Strong emotions that come up at this time are apt to trigger a physical response that could be quite powerful, even a bit violent. Be careful of such tendencies.",Libra
"May 31, 2022 - Emotionally speaking, you're a bit vulnerable today, Libra, and it may be hard to find shelter from the storm. It's drafty under your umbrella, and water seems to be leaking in from the top. Comfort yourself by centering and enjoying a quiet evening at home. Don't let other people's unsolved problems infect your space. Differentiate between issues that concern you and those that are out of your control.",Libra
"Jun 1, 2022 - You should feel especially warm and loving today toward just about anyone you meet, Libra. Good news about money may have caused you to feel especially positive. This could attract new people to you and bring closer those already in your life. If you've been thinking about starting an artistic project, this is the day to do it. Creative ideas should flow freely. Have fun.",Libra

"Jun 3, 2022 - Communication with those closest to you might prove difficult today, Libra. You might end up playing endless phone tag.

"Jun 4, 2022 - Surprising new developments in close friendships or love relationships could come your way today, Libra. Someone might move away or perhaps move closer to you.

You may even discover that people can respect and appreciate you even if you aren't constantly on the defensive.",Libra

"Jun 11, 2022 - Dealing with the ups and downs of other family members could be easier for you today than usual, Libra.

You may see a lot of things in a different light today.",Libra
"Jun 12, 2022 - Volatile emotions may come to the surface among the members of your household today. This could prove irritating for you, Libra, but try to avoid becoming involved in others' quarrels.

You might have to make a few decisions by this time next week.",Libra
"Jun 17, 2022 - You've always been a loner, Libra. You tend to act on your own and you don't trust outside help. Over the last few weeks, however, you've managed to find people who have accepted you the way you are. It's as if you've found a refuge where you can escape reality. But you'll find that if you open your heart to others, there will be additional places of refuge.",Libra
"Jun 18, 2022 - The people around you would really appreciate it if you'd slow down and relax a little. You always seem to be running around, so much so, in fact, that you've been neglecting the people close to you, especially your family. They really need you. They have issues to discuss with you.

"Jun 25, 2022 - The financial picture continues to improve, Libra. At some point during the day, you might have the feeling that you aren't working hard enough to keep the forward motion going, and you might feel panic rise. This could prove a good motivating factor, but you don't need to push yourself harder than you're going now. You're on a roll and it's likely to continue. Just pace yourself.",Libra
"Jun 26, 2022 - Today you might be feeling a bit tense, Libra, and you probably won't understand why. The secret? It's the planets.

"Jun 30, 2022 - Unexpected events may be shuffling the cards when you least expect it, Libra. If you have kept a close eye on the deck, counting the jacks as they turn up, you might get thrown for a loop. Don't be discouraged. Everyone else is subject to the same rules as you are.

"Feb 4, 2023 - Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Libra.

"Jul 5, 2022 - Today is your day to dream and dream big, Libra. Think about what it is that you want most out of life. Aim your arrow to the stars and pull back your bow as far as possible. There's no limit to how far you can go. Your only limitation is your imagination. Don't worry if your plan doesn't seem to make any rational sense. Worry more about what you want and less about how you're going to get it.",Libra
"Jul 6, 2022 - Someone has turned on the fan and papers are flying everywhere, Libra. The pace of things is picking up and you're scrambling to pick up the pieces.

Love and romance could take on a fairytale aura, Libra. You might view current and potential love partners through rose-colored glasses, seeing only their endearing traits.

"Jul 11, 2022 - Libra, don't be surprised if some of your fantasies and dreams are put on trial today by a harsh force that cuts right to the truth of the matter.

This may be the start of a whole new life.",Libra
"Jul 16, 2022 - Don't even try to understand what's happening today, Libra, because you won't be able to fathom it.

"Jul 18, 2022 - Today you could find yourself seeking self-knowledge through relationships, Libra, especially through assisting those you love. Someone is troubled and needs your help.

Your optimism is very high, and you have what it takes to pass it on to others.",Libra
"Jul 19, 2022 - Tension in your romantic life is apt to well up today, Libra. More than likely, there are certain responsibilities that you feel you have to attend to that take you away from your intimate experience with another.

Try to find a healthy balance between work and play.",Libra
"Jul 20, 2022 - Be prepared to work diligently toward making your dreams a reality today, Libra. Success is definitely on the way, though it may not be approaching quite as quickly as you might like.

"Jul 24, 2022 - When it comes to issues that require real thinking, be careful of letting someone else take control. You might have a rather lazy attitude in this department, Libra, and it could be tempting to simply let someone else do the thinking for you.

"Jul 25, 2022 - Your thinking is clear and sharp, Libra, and your mental awareness keen. You should use it to head toward new, forward-thinking projects.

Don't feel pressured to give in to the social norm.",Libra
"Jul 28, 2022 - Someone may be calling you on certain behaviors today, Libra. It could be that your aggressive nature rubs someone the wrong way and they simply don't have thick enough skin to take it.

This is a good day to see things from someone else's perspective in order to gain a bit more data on the situation.",Libra
"Jul 29, 2022 - There's a great deal of fuel to keep your fire raging today, Libra. Powerful situations are apt to come your way in which you're asked to take decisive action.

"Jul 30, 2022 - Don't try to force anything or anyone right now, Libra. You'll find that today's elements are just as stubborn as you are.

Face it - you've been planning for a long time without making much concrete progress. All that is about to change.",Libra
"Jul 31, 2022 - You're a dreamer at heart, Libra. You prefer not to think about material things. That explains why you tend to forget groceries or dry cleaning.

You'll feel better by day's end just knowing you can be self-sufficient even if you don't want to be.",Libra
"Aug 1, 2022 - Think before you act today, Libra. Rash moves are likely to get you into trouble. An annoying interruption in your daily routine could throw you off guard.

It's time to slow down.",Libra
"Aug 2, 2022 - You may feel a bit of a creative block now, Libra, but don't view this as a signal to stop pursuing your artistic goals.

Get back in the flow.",Libra
"Aug 3, 2022 - There's an incredibly expansive feeling in the air that you should latch onto, Libra. Things are moving rapidly. You'll find long-term trends come together quite well.

Brace yourself, reassess your methods, and get back in the saddle.",Libra
"Aug 5, 2022 - You may be feeling rather anxious, Libra. Perhaps you have a big date coming up and your mind is buzzing with how to make the best impression.

Try not to get too caught up with yourself.",Libra
"Aug 6, 2022 - Be careful not to overdo things today, Libra. You may so zealously want to meet your goals that you overshoot the mark by quite a bit.

At the same time, be careful about getting so carried away that you don't notice that you've already reached the finish line.",Libra
"Aug 7, 2022 - You're an adventurous soul, Libra. Are you thinking about a little mischief today?

You've been bored lately, so who could blame you? If you decide to do this, make sure everyone knows what's up. You don't want to burn any bridges.",Libra
"Aug 8, 2022 - Frustrated energy resulting from an inability to put plans into action could have your nerves on edge today, Libra.

An emotional event concerning your family, perhaps planning a wedding or other milestone, could have you feeling especially moved.

"Aug 19, 2022 - Today's a good day to check into advancing your career or education, Libra. The energy favors expansion and growth. When was the last time you learned a new skill?

Now is the time to do things full force.",Libra
"Aug 23, 2022 - Today your mind will be quick, insightful, and inspired, Libra. Your creative impulses should go a thousand miles an hour and ideas should pop in and out of your head like crazy. Most likely you'll want to drop everything else and write down all your ideas. Make use of this inspiration while you can, as it may come in fits and starts. You could be surprised by what you produce.",Libra
"Aug 24, 2022 - Unfinished job tasks might have you wanting to pitch in and get them done no matter what it takes, Libra. This is likely to earn you a few brownie points with your colleagues but take care that you don't stress yourself out. You probably woke up feeling pretty good this morning, but you won't finish the day that way if you exhaust yourself. Pace yourself.",Libra
"Aug 25, 2022 - Some action you took yesterday may be opposed today, Libra. Unclear facts and romantic fantasies could get in the way of your taking decisive action.

Make the most of today's auspicious circumstances, Libra.",Libra
"Aug 28, 2022 - Financial worries might come up today, Libra. You may check your bank balance and find that you have little money. This might come as a shock, because you thought there was plenty there. Before you panic, ask whoever's in charge at the bank to double-check the records. It's probably a computer error. It shouldn't take long to correct, and you'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief.",Libra
"Aug 29, 2022 - Libra, you're usually more outwardly directed, but today you might break that pattern. You could be in a contemplative mood and wondering about everything from metaphysics to philosophy to money to your future. You're basically feeling positive about life, but you might be at a crossroads now. It may take some serious thought before you decide which direction to go. Give yourself some time.",Libra
"Aug 30, 2022 - There's tension in the air today, Libra, and you might be restless and anxious to start something. There is plenty of energy around to feed you, but the trick is to make sure that you're doing things for the right reasons. Don't do things out of guilt, fear, or regret. Keep on the best path for the best reasons for the best results.",Libra
"Aug 31, 2022 - You may be feeling a bit on edge today, Libra. Your self-confidence is shaky and you may feel in need of new challenges. The tedious tasks you have in front of you don't inspire your imagination or creativity. Do what you can to get through this difficult day. Be extra kind to yourself by indulging in a good lunch or listening to classical music.",Libra
"Sep 1, 2022 - Emotionally speaking, you should be doing quite well today, Libra, especially in the morning. This is a good time to take charge of projects that require definite leadership.

You have what it takes to lead.",Libra
"Sep 2, 2022 - Emotions could be intense at work today as important projects approach their deadlines, Libra. You may put in more time than usual. Tempers might flare and co-workers clash, so stay calm and keep going. On the positive side, the financial and recognition payoffs for whatever you accomplish today should prove well worth the effort.",Libra
"Sep 3, 2022 - You could have a strong urge to seek adventure, Libra. You might want to take a spontaneous trip to an exotic place, meet new people in exciting fields, or try new pastimes, perhaps as outrageous as skydiving. Go for it if you are able, but this urge could indicate boredom in some part of your life. What can you change about your lifestyle to avoid future stagnation?",Libra
"Sep 4, 2022 - There could be some restrictions on your emotions today, Libra. You'll find that a practical, grounded force is working against your intuitive understanding of whatever issue concerns you. Do your best to anchor yourself in the truth before you scatter seeds of erratic emotions all over the place. It's important for you to maintain stability at all times.",Libra
"Sep 5, 2022 - Today, Libra, you might turn to practices like meditation or psychic development. Some vivid dreams over the past few days may have brought up personal issues that you need to clear up in order to progress.

"Sep 6, 2022 - Today you could be feeling warm and friendly toward everyone. You might be involved in virtual social events or receive invitations to future parties.

There could be colds or other bugs flying around and you could be more susceptible to such infections at this time.",Libra
"Sep 7, 2022 - Misinformation regarding money could come from someone who has a stake in your believing whatever you're told. This could be a banker, creditor, investment counselor, or even a close friend or relative. Whoever it is, Libra, don't accept what this person says at face value. Look into the facts of the situation yourself before making any decisions about what you need to do.",Libra
"Sep 8, 2022 - Things relating to love and romance are in your favor today, Libra, although you may find that issues of this nature might be unpredictable. Lovers could be present one moment and MIA the next, but these are the risks you take when you deal with love. Find a balance that doesn't get you so wrapped up in someone else that you're hurt if his or her eyes turn elsewhere.",Libra
"Sep 9, 2022 - Today you're likely to experience a powerful burst of energy that may temporarily turn you into a workaholic. Chores may have piled up around the house that desperately need to be done. You may want to go through them like wildfire. You don't have to do them all at once. Take care of the most pressing tasks and then relax. The rest can wait. Ask family members to help.",Libra
"Sep 10, 2022 - Crazy as it seems, why not plan that trip you've been eager to go on, Libra? Adventure calls, and although there are a few obstacles to stop you from answering, you can’t wait to get out of your rut. There is a great big world out there, and you can’t wait to make the time to go and see some of it!",Libra
"Sep 11, 2022 - This is a time when you're likely to feel especially idealistic and hopeful. Spiritual experiences may have you on cloud nine, Libra. Your intuition is also strong. You might consider taking a future trip to a distant state or foreign country, perhaps one associated with a great spiritual tradition. Wait a day or two and talk it over with friends before making any specific arrangements.",Libra
"Sep 12, 2022 - Something you might have wanted to keep between you and a few trusted friends could inadvertently be revealed, perhaps to the wrong people. Frustration and a sense of betrayal could plague you, but don't turn against those who knew. Even though this can be disconcerting, you can learn from it. Benjamin Franklin said, ""Two people can keep a secret only when one of them is dead.""",Libra
"Sep 13, 2022 - This is a day of fresh beginnings for you, Libra. Accomplishments in the past foster a new sense of self-confidence, along with optimism and enthusiasm for the future. Travel lies ahead in the distant future, and possibly advancing your education in some way. Romance also looks promising. Go for a facial or massage today, if possible, or buy some new clothes. Start the new cycle by making your appearance match what you feel inside.",Libra
"Sep 14, 2022 - You're in a fun-loving and jovial mood today, Libra, and you should make time to enjoy it with friends, if possible. The one caveat to the day is that your emotions may be a bit clouded. You may not have the most accurate impression of a situation. You might feel that people have the wrong impression of who you are. Try not to feel insecure. Have confidence in yourself and take the lead.",Libra
"Sep 15, 2022 - Other people's indecisiveness could leave you feeling frustrated and stuck today, Libra. Realize that you can overcome this by pushing past them.

You aren't responsible for the well-being of others. Concentrate on you.",Libra
"Sep 16, 2022 - If you're musically or artistically inclined, Libra, today you might have visions or melodies in your head that simply cry out to be written down.

It's a good idea to start working on these projects today or they could disappear.",Libra
"Sep 17, 2022 - You may feel especially warm and loving, Libra, and romance could be on your mind. Time spent with a love partner from another state or country might seem especially appealing. This is a great day to schedule an intimate evening alone with your friend and see where it takes you. All signs indicate that your friend returns your feelings, and you might end up just where you want!",Libra
"Sep 18, 2022 - Have you been having difficulties with career or money matters, Libra? If so, help might come today from a friend who lives far away. This person may not do much but offer words that are so insightful that you know immediately what course of action to take. What this person says could also be of valuable assistance in the future. Write it down so you'll be sure to remember it.",Libra
"Sep 19, 2022 - If you've put in your time and done your homework, this day can prove very rewarding, Libra. Watch out for incredible opportunities hiding nearby.

Shed the chains and live the way you want to live.",Libra
"Sep 20, 2022 - You might have the chance to speak with new people in interesting fields, perhaps from foreign lands, Libra.

Intriguing ideas and useful information could have your mind buzzing all night. Try to take a walk in the evening to clear your head.",Libra
"Sep 21, 2022 - Matters involving communication seem to be fouled up, Libra. Messages may not get delivered, emails may not go through, and people might misinterpret your words. This could create a mess that brings everything to a screeching halt. You need to speak to people directly, give detailed instructions, use simple language, and make sure they take notes, or beware of the consequences!",Libra
"Sep 22, 2022 - You're in a great position to reap the rewards from all your past hard work, Libra. In the coming weeks you'll be able to realize important gains in your career and personal projects. Not only should you see significant advancements in your work life, but you'll also achieve greater personal happiness. You have great momentum, so keep it up and you'll realize your goals.",Libra
"Sep 23, 2022 - A reassessment of your financial goals may be needed now, Libra. Some of your expectations may be unrealistic, and you might need to look at them in a more practical light. This doesn't mean they won't happen, just that they're apt to take a little longer than you'd like. Think of it as an opportunity to develop patience. Rework your budget and hang in there!",Libra
"Sep 24, 2022 - Love matters have been going well for you recently, Libra, but today you could be alone and unable to reach a current or potential romantic interest. This could bring about a twinge of the blues, which up until now have passed you by. Don't waste time feeling down. Find something to distract you until your friend can come around to see you and you can have a little fun.",Libra
"Sep 25, 2022 - You'll do some serious soul searching today. Which goals have you achieved and which ones have gone unattained? Be honest as you reflect on past months. Could you have done things differently? Would you like to do things differently in the future? You'd be well advised to write down your successes and regrets. Use the list to keep you on track. It's bound to be a great help to you.",Libra
"Sep 26, 2022 - A future journey may be in the works right now, Libra. Many changes have been occurring in your life for a long time, and they continue today. They might involve group events or educational activities. This may be something you've anticipated for a long time. Your energy, enthusiasm, and excitement are high. You may be too restless to sit still. Try to get some exercise at some point.",Libra
"Sep 27, 2022 - Are you going to go away soon, Libra? If not, you may be planning a trip for another month, perhaps going for educational purposes, such as to attend a workshop. You might have agreed to some overseas business travel. You should feel especially energetic, enthusiastic, and optimistic now. You've done well thanks to your diligent work, and you should continue on that path.",Libra
"Sep 28, 2022 - Too many phone calls may be on the agenda today, Libra. You might also have a few last-minute errands to run in your neighborhood. It won't be easy, probably because of unexpected delays, closures and traffic. Nonetheless, your sense of excitement and enthusiasm will help you tolerate conditions that would normally be very frustrating. Furthermore, you're having fun! Go to it.",Libra
"Sep 29, 2022 - Your thoughts today are likely to turn to setting goals for the future, particularly concerning your career. While you've made a lot of progress in recent months, you'd like to see even more forward movement. This would be a great day to start thinking of concrete ways to make that happen, Libra. Why not have a family brainstorming session? It's likely to yield some great advice.",Libra
"Sep 30, 2022 - This is a good day for sharing friendship with pals and co-workers, Libra. People will be in a light, socializing mood and not much in a working frame of mind. There's really no use fighting this energy. Enjoy yourself today and allow yourself to detach from work issues. You can all get back to the grindstone later. The work will still be there.",Libra
"Feb 4, 2023 - Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Libra. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra
"Oct 1, 2022 - Are you single, Libra? If so, today you might fall in love at first sight. You may have been frustrated lately by the lack of available, interesting people, but today you could meet someone who seems too perfect for words. And you can rest assured that the attraction is mutual! If you're already involved, you can expect a revival of the fairytale romance between you and a significant other.",Libra
"Oct 2, 2022 - People would be foolish to challenge your thinking now, Libra. The power behind your words is volatile, and you may find yourself going to extremes in order to get your point across. Be careful about making promises you can't fulfill. It could be that you're so adamant about your point of view that you make up hyperbolic situations just to get your ideas across.",Libra
"Oct 3, 2022 - Today is one of those days in which you will be bursting at the seams to share big news with your friends, Libra. Perhaps you just received an important package or piece of information and you can't wait to spread the news. Be careful about who might be lurking around, however, because there could be others listening in. They may not necessarily be acting in your best interests.",Libra
"Oct 4, 2022 - Suppose you were someone else for a day, Libra. How would it feel to be treated the way you normally treat other people? This is a good time to put yourself in someone else's shoes and experience life through their eyes. By doing this, you're apt to become more conscious of your own actions and the effect of those actions on the people around you.",Libra
"Oct 5, 2022 - You've been very busy, professionally and socially, and now you're probably longing for a romantic encounter. If you're currently involved, you should schedule some time alone with the special person in your life. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if someone new appears on the scene. You could fall in love at first sight or an old friend could suddenly look different to you. Make sure you look your best!",Libra
"Oct 6, 2022 - Love and personal relationships are likely to take on a much dreamier and more romantic tone now, Libra. Your eyes are apt to sparkle as you speak or even think of the person you care about the most. The unmistakable glow that surrounds you is likely to attract others to your side even if you aren't in the market for a romantic relationship right now.",Libra
"Oct 7, 2022 - When it comes to matters of love and romance, you may need to tone things down a bit, Libra. An aggressive approach now may drive your loved one further away from you instead of drawing him or her closer. Remember that love is a two-way street. Don't just do things the way you'd like to do them. It's crucial that you consider your partner's thoughts and feelings every step of the way.",Libra
"Oct 8, 2022 - Your coals have been smoldering for a while, and there is a great deal of smoke pouring from your blackened embers, Libra. The good news is that there's apt to be a great gust of wind today, acting as the catalyst that ignites the flames. You've provided the heat and the fuel. The missing element of air is finally coming your way, so be prepared. The fire is apt to heat up quickly.",Libra
"Oct 9, 2022 - You might be feeling rather insecure when it comes to your peace of mind, Libra. Because of the insecurity, it may seem like your relationships are on the rocks. At the same time, having problems in your relationships is making you less likely to trust these close partners with your insecure feelings. Talking about your emotions in an honest manner will help you break out of this difficult situation.",Libra
"Oct 10, 2022 - Expect some delays, upsets, and unexpected turns when it comes to romance today, Libra. Jealousy may rear its ugly head, as you may at some point get the impression that your beloved is noticing someone else. Bear in mind that there's a strong chance that these impressions are illusory, and that the truth may be totally different from the way things seem. Take care to stay focused. Reserve judgment until you know the facts.",Libra
"Oct 11, 2022 - Your mind will be especially quick and active today, Libra, and you're likely to want to spend much of the day involved in intellectual activities like reading, writing, or teaching. Communication with others should be a powerful part of your day, so you will probably spend time on the phone. You will want to write down many of the ideas you hear. You will find most of them interesting and want to remember them.",Libra
"Oct 12, 2022 - A very welcome sum of extra money could come your way today, Libra, possibly out of the blue. You might want to put this money to work for you in some way, perhaps investing it or purchasing supplies or materials for personal projects. You should feel especially positive where your resources are concerned, and confident in your ability to earn.",Libra
"Oct 13, 2022 - You've probably had few periods when business and finance have gone well for you, Libra. Now this trend seems to be coming to a head. Today you might start or close some type of agreement that will make a big difference to your finances. Your money situation should not only improve but also stabilize at a level higher than it's ever been. As long as you're diligent, this growth should continue.",Libra
"Oct 14, 2022 - You took off like a bullet a few days ago, making great progress in a short amount of time. Now you're grappling with doubts that are undermining all of your energy. Reflecting on the events of the past few days, it's obvious that you were somewhat reckless in your headlong pursuit of your goals. Don't give up, Libra. Rethink your strategy.",Libra
"Oct 15, 2022 - Chores that need to be done around the house could be at the top of your priority list today, Libra. A female visitor, perhaps your mother, could come by and making your place look great will preoccupy you. Don't do any more work than you absolutely have to. You won't want to be too tired when she arrives.",Libra
"Oct 16, 2022 - There could be an unexpected tension coming out of nowhere today, Libra. More than likely your emotions will be running at a high level. It could be that your aggressiveness and assertiveness start to annoy others. People might snap suddenly. Don't be surprised if things come without much warning. There is a fast-paced feeling to the day that will be hard to ignore.",Libra
"Oct 17, 2022 - Powerful thoughts are running through your brain. You will find that this information can be transforming, Libra. The key is to learn from others and incorporate opposing viewpoints into your state of mind. Don't automatically disregard the opinion of another just because it contradicts your own beliefs. Teamwork is the name of the game on a day like today.",Libra
"Oct 18, 2022 - You have two choices today. Either jump into the thick of the mess with both feet or stay out of it altogether. There are definitely two distinct camps setting up their arsenals for battle. Realize that there is also a soft, tender, harmonious aspect that just wants peace. It will be hard to ignore the fact that your usual warring nature is ready to do battle.",Libra
"Oct 19, 2022 - You might need to put on the brakes today, Libra. Your present trajectory isn't quite in line with the people and energy around you. Make sure you aren't stepping on other people's toes with your abrasive behavior. This is a day to consider a more disciplined approach. You might need to establish a better structure, so you use your energy more efficiently in general.",Libra
"Oct 20, 2022 - You might consider taking a rest today, Libra. Like a sailboat on the ocean, you've been taxed lately by all the turbulence. The pressure on you has been tremendous. Think about pulling your sails to half-mast in order to take a break. You may not be going as quickly as before, but you will find that this is exactly the rest you need in order to complete the voyage.",Libra
"Oct 21, 2022 - The day's energy is apt to be lively, making it much easier to get the things done that you need to do, Libra. You will find people are more than eager to help you. The trick is to integrate your leadership abilities with the knowledge available from other people. You will create a winning combination of power and strength to put to use in just about any realm of your life.",Libra
"Oct 22, 2022 - Too much pressure on the job could have you feeling like chucking it all and going somewhere by yourself. You might be tempted to go on a spending spree or overindulge in food or drink. This may spill over into your personal relationships, causing disagreements with friends or family. It might be a good idea to be alone for a few hours, Libra. You will feel much better once you clear your head.",Libra
"Oct 23, 2022 - Worries about money could be on your mind today, Libra. A check you've been expecting may not have arrived. Perhaps a project you've taken on is taking longer to complete than you thought, and so expected funds are delayed. The key word to remember here is ""delayed."" It's late, not cancelled altogether. Be patient and don't waste any more time worrying!",Libra
"Oct 24, 2022 - Sudden lucky breaks could come your way today, Libra, possibly through friends or groups with which you're involved. A long-term goal you've been working toward might bring unexpected but wonderful results. Virtual group activities, particularly those involving social or political issues, could take up a lot of your time. This promises to be a busy, productive day. Expect the unexpected!",Libra
"Oct 25, 2022 - A conflict between your responsibilities to family and obligations to friends could rear its ugly head today, Libra. You might want to attend an event but need to deal with emotional issues in the home immediately. It could be difficult to keep a cool head under these circumstances. If you can, you should find a way to satisfy your family and go out. Step back and be objective!",Libra
"Oct 26, 2022 - An old friend you haven't seen for a long time may suddenly resurface, perhaps contacting you through social media. This could take you by surprise, Libra, but you won't be any less happy to talk to him or her again. Surprising news of another kind may come to you through email or phone, and this might set you off in a totally different direction from the one you started in this morning.",Libra
"Oct 27, 2022 - Success in a project you've been working on could mean you want to go out and celebrate. You might feel guilty about doing it, but go ahead, Libra. Order a glass of wine and dessert! Tonight is the night to forget work and go for sheer, unadulterated pleasure. You have the break coming. Your efforts are finally being recognized, and you're on your way. Enjoy your good fortune!",Libra
"Oct 28, 2022 - Meticulous and sincere effort on your part may have led to a recent increase in income. Today you might be thinking of reworking your budget.

You've worked hard to get where you are, and you deserve a reward.",Libra
"Oct 29, 2022 - A new opportunity could come your way today, Libra. There's no promise or guarantee, but there is an indication that if you devote yourself thoroughly, your chances of progress are pretty good over the next month for any activity that you begin today. Keep up the good work and keep smiling! The latter action is as important as the former.",Libra
"Oct 30, 2022 - You may have the perfect plan all laid out, Libra. You've communicated to the right people, you've traveled to the appropriate spots to gather data, and you have all your resources in line. For some reason, however, every time you start to implement this plan, you run into emotional difficulties that seem too challenging to surmount. Don't let this block you from your dreams.",Libra
"Oct 31, 2022 - Someone has suddenly put the fan on high, Libra, and papers are blowing everywhere. Neat piles whisked into large swirls of chaos. Everyone is shouting opinions about what should be done about it. Meanwhile, there are people making demands on you that you just can't handle. Slow down and communicate your situation to others. They will understand and support your predicament. The wind will die down soon.",Libra
"Nov 1, 2022 - Things may get a bit difficult in your romantic life because of someone in the partnership who isn't necessarily taking a very realistic approach to the situation, Libra. There's a bit of a power play going on as someone tries to throw their weight around without considering the other person's feelings. Tension is brewing, and you'd be wise to deal with it now.",Libra
"Nov 2, 2022 - Uncertainty about spiritual matters and doubt about your insights might have you down in the dumps today. Don't try to force any solutions - it won't work. This isn't a good day to be out and about, because travel of any kind could pose problems. This is also a bad day to plan or start a vacation. Stay close to home and take care of practicalities, Libra. That way you will be calm by evening.",Libra
"Nov 3, 2022 - You may have doubts over the next few days, Libra. Don't make any important decisions about your future during this relatively unproductive period. If someone in your professional or personal life asks you to make more of a commitment, you may be tempted to put on the brakes without really knowing why. Wait a while before answering this kind of question.",Libra
"Nov 4, 2022 - In navigating the seas of your emotional life, Libra, you may feel as though you've made a great effort over the past month. You've been available and conciliatory and have done your best to maintain harmony. With today's celestial energy, you want to be more spontaneous. The enterprising and reckless you has returned!",Libra
"Nov 5, 2022 - You will likely find it difficult to keep your mind on serious matters with today's playful planetary energies, Libra. You're in the mood for romance, and you want to make sure everything is in place for a flawless evening with that special someone. You have the sexy outfit and food being delivered, and that's just for starters. No wonder you can't concentrate, with such an amazing evening to look forward to.",Libra
"Nov 6, 2022 - Your aggressive attitude is likely to start a fight that might be difficult to settle now, Libra. There are extremely stubborn forces at work, and you may find that no one is willing to budge from their position. The thing that is apt to make this even more difficult is that people may misinterpret certain pieces of the puzzle. Try to bring understanding to the situation instead of more aggression.",Libra
"Nov 7, 2022 - Don't spend beyond your means today, Libra! If you happen to know some enthusiastic shoppers, it could be disastrous for your finances if you get caught up in the frenzy. On the other hand, perhaps you owe yourself a reward for all your hard work. Is there a gift you could give yourself that doesn't involve money? Time, perhaps?",Libra
"Nov 8, 2022 - Don't expect to meet the partner of your dreams today, Libra. Rather, your romantic hopes are likely to meet with frustration. It would be better to devote your energies to something more realistic, such as your financial situation. It probably does need some attention, wouldn't you agree? If you redirect your energy, the rewards are more likely to be forthcoming.",Libra
"Nov 9, 2022 - In a series of days that have tested your patience to the limit, here comes the moment of truth that could make or break you.

Do your best to remain levelheaded, Libra.",Libra

Tell yourself how proud you would be if you could get this done. Don't give up and don't change directions on your way. Stay focused!",Libra
"Nov 11, 2022 - You may feel like the brakes have been slammed in the romance department, Libra. Realize that this doesn't mean you have to stop having fun. Laughter and good times are in store for you today as long as you don't get hung up on the slow pace of your love life. You can have a good time while taking things one step at a time. Savor each moment. Don't try to rush to the next.",Libra
"Nov 12, 2022 - It's possible that you're trying to do too much, Libra. If look at the days you spend working, you may realize that too much of your energy goes to some very meager results. Today, consider taking some time off to take advantage of life. Why not go out for a nice dinner with friends, or even better, go on a little vacation? Try and let things happen. You deserve time just for you!",Libra
"Nov 13, 2022 - Your energy is probably high today, almost to the point where you feel you might be able to run a marathon! Seriously, Libra, you're probably thinking in terms of getting out of town for a while. Exercising or participating in solo sports could also be appealing. You might direct some of this energy into creative projects. Take care not to overdo it. You could still get too tired.",Libra
"Nov 14, 2022 - A desire to be creative could have you experimenting with various kinds of artistic disciplines, perhaps in connection with computers, Libra. At some point today you could be in the right place at the right time, receiving just the right help from someone who can point you in whatever direction you want to go. Ambitious plans could fill your head and keep your mind buzzing. Make a list! It might help.",Libra
"Nov 15, 2022 - Chances are good that you will feel strong and confident today, Libra. It's a good time to try something you've never done before. You might be the right person to get things started, especially if it's about something you want to see changed. If you've never run for office before or taken a leadership role in another area, consider doing this. You have the power and popularity to make a real difference.",Libra
"Nov 16, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you feel a real need for some breathing room today, Libra. As much as you enjoy the company of others, you need to have time to yourself as well. See if you can work in a private space or simply shut your door. If you need to move in order to be alone, hop in the car and go. Irritability is a good indicator of when you need to get away from the crowd.",Libra
"Nov 17, 2022 - Your plane is fueled, your bags packed, and you have clearance from the control tower, but for some reason, Libra, you just can't seem to get off the ground. Perhaps there are details of the trip that you haven't taken into account. People are firing questions at you, and you don't have all the answers. This is especially true when it comes to matters of love and romance.",Libra
"Nov 18, 2022 - Often fiery temperaments like yours are drawn to fight for great causes despite the better judgment of more down-to-Earth people. As a result, you have great leadership potential that may emerge today. Your courage, enthusiasm, and vigor will be contagious when you climb onto your soapbox.",Libra
"Nov 19, 2022 - It's time to get what you need, Libra. Your desires don't always go in a direction that does you the most good, and this can cause tension. You feel as though it's impossible to combine your desires with what is good for you, notably in your love life. You wrestle with whether you should remain in your ""creative"" cave or share your life with someone. It doesn't have to be one or the other.",Libra
"Nov 20, 2022 - Is discipline high on your list of priorities lately, Libra? You're undoubtedly trying to inject some order into your daily life, and your behavior could benefit from some adjustment as well. Whether it concerns food, hygiene, or simply the intensity of your daily rhythm, it's possible that you will notice a real improvement today.",Libra
"Nov 21, 2022 - Information could come your way today that starts you thinking about new and revolutionary ideas. Perhaps they involve modern technology or social and political issues. Opportunities to meet new friends who share your interests could come through group activities. You should be feeling especially curious and optimistic about the future, Libra, and whatever exchanges with others you have are likely to set your mind buzzing.",Libra
"Nov 22, 2022 - The day ahead should give you an opportunity to analyze the events of the past three weeks, Libra. You will draw many important conclusions about your love life. You may conclude that matters have evolved little, if at all. This is discouraging, to be sure, but don't place too much trust in appearances. Remember, things aren't always as they seem.",Libra
"Nov 23, 2022 - Feel free to stand up for yourself, a cause, or another person today, even if you know it will cause tension among the others around you. A heated argument is likely to ensue, and it wouldn't be surprising if you were the catalyst. Passionate debates are right up your alley, so use this as an opportunity to demonstrate your courage and strength in what you believe.",Libra
"Nov 24, 2022 - Financial issues may interfere with your self-expression today, Libra. Perhaps you need a little more money before proceeding with a project that means a lot to you. You usually aren't one to let this kind of consideration stop you, though. Just a little bit of thought and planning could make whatever it is you want to do more feasible than it appears to be. Write down some ideas and go to it!",Libra
"Nov 25, 2022 - You might feel a great deal of physical power on a day like today, Libra. If someone asks you to come help move a couch, you're likely to be able to pick up the whole thing by yourself. Don't sell yourself short. You have more internal strength than you reveal to others. There's no need to hide it any longer. Feel free to make use of this great power you possess.",Libra
"Nov 26, 2022 - People sometimes say that you're a little aggressive in your approach, Libra. But today you feel a little tired of leading the charge on the battlefield. You can learn a lot from your friends who can teach you to think of things in relative terms without allowing yourself to become emotionally involved in every situation. Try to relax for a change!",Libra
"Nov 27, 2022 - Act without hesitation today, Libra, especially if you're following unfamiliar directions or exploring new territory. This may not seem like the best advice, but this is a day for saying an unflinching yes to all manner of proposals that come your way, even if some are unclear. Libra excels at this type of test. Expect to be at the head of the class by the end of the day!",Libra
"Nov 28, 2022 - There's extra aggression in your world today, Libra. Realize that this is probably due more to your reaction to a situation than to the situation itself. It could be that you're in conflict with someone just because he or she wants harmony while you have a propensity to fight. This paradox is likely to be detrimental to your psyche unless you try to change it.",Libra
"Nov 29, 2022 - Emotionally speaking, you're probably doing quite well today, Libra. You have extra self-confidence to draw on to tackle your projects. The one difficult aspect of the day probably has to do with some sort of mental challenge that for some reason just isn't making sense. Don't continue to beat a dead horse. If things don't want to budge, let them sit. Tackle them later.",Libra
"Nov 30, 2022 - You took off like a bullet a few days ago, Libra, making great progress in a short amount of time. But now you're grappling with doubts that are undermining all your energy. Reflecting on the events of the past few days, it's obvious that you were somewhat reckless in your headlong pursuit of your goals. Don't give up! Just rethink your strategy.",Libra
"Feb 4, 2023 - Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Libra. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.",Libra
"Dec 1, 2022 - Someone you've known for a long time may move away or otherwise vanish from your life. He or she may move to a distant state. You'll probably stay in touch by phone or email, but it will never be the same, at least not for a long time. You will feel better if you meet some new people. They will come your way today, possibly through humanitarian group activities.",Libra
"Dec 2, 2022 - You're apt to be in a romantic mood today, Libra. Your whole being may revolve around love and romance. You will find that your romanticism is heightened. This is a terrific day to snuggle up to a loved one and share intimate moments and passionate kisses. Pamper yourself with a hot bath and try to make someone else happy.",Libra
"Dec 3, 2022 - Latch on to the expansiveness that comes when you connect with others in the social arena, Libra. Communication is a key part of the day. You will find that if you go with the flow, you will land exactly where you need to be. Take the adventurous route and feel free to skip around from one thing to another. There's no need to pin yourself down to only one way of doing something.",Libra
"Dec 4, 2022 - You will find that discipline, organization, and a bit of a dramatic flair are exactly the things needed to be successful today, Libra. Just because you have to be practical doesn't mean that you have to be stern and grumpy. Remember that taking care of serious matters can actually be fun as long as you maintain a positive attitude about the situation. A smile goes a long way.",Libra
"Dec 5, 2022 - You will find that the more peaceful and understanding you are today, Libra, the better off you will be in general. Doors will open and people will welcome you with great fanfare. Be the diplomat instead of the warrior. Focus on the positive aspects of the equation instead of the negative. Luck and prosperity will come your way when you have this attitude wherever you go.",Libra
"Dec 6, 2022 - Don't try to control what happens today, Libra, because you won't be able to fathom what's going on. How could it be otherwise when collective currents are interfering with your life? You may do some soul-searching because you may feel that you're only a grain of sand in a vast universe. Don't spend too much time staring at your belly button. Look around you for some of the answers.",Libra
"Dec 7, 2022 - Libra, no one has ever accused you of being overly diplomatic. In fact, since you have no compunction about saying what you think, your mouth regularly gets you into trouble. It's true that your verbal outbursts often relieve tension in tight situations, but there are times when kind words are a more effective way to get a point across. Why not try it?",Libra
"Dec 8, 2022 - Someone you think of as a friend may prove less than trustworthy today, Libra. There are indications of deception all around you. Perhaps someone is keeping something from you or telling outright lies. Don't be too suspicious of anyone but check the facts of a situation before you take someone's word for anything. It's always best to do that anyway.",Libra
"Dec 9, 2022 - A new friend could arrive today, Libra. You're probably going to like this person very much. He or she probably shares many of your interests. You could become close friends. The downside is that you aren't likely to see anyone as they really are, only an idealized picture. When you meet this person, try to see the real person behind the mask and accept them as they are.",Libra
"Dec 10, 2022 - A sudden, irritating interruption in your routine could come your way today, Libra. A friend may need some advice, and you could feel obliged to give it, which would put your own projects on hold for a while. Don't be too irritated with this person, however. You might regret it later. You might also have some troubles with computers, cell phones, or other forms of technology.",Libra
"Dec 11, 2022 - Calm down and get centered, Libra. This is an extremely sensual day that's likely to pique your emotions. You're apt to receive input from each one of your senses, so keep these channels open and available for new information that's trying to break through. Don't be hasty. You're better off taking a reserved, receptive approach today.",Libra
"Dec 12, 2022 - The weightiness of the past few days seems to be lifting. You will find a slight breeze building that will help fuel your fire, Libra. By building a solid foundation, you've created a reliable launching pad from which to take off. Communicate what you've learned with others. Allow your opinion to be heard. A great deal of useful information will be exchanged.",Libra
"Dec 13, 2022 - There's apt to be tension between your heart and your general mood, Libra. Your romantic nature will incline you to adopt a selfish, impatient attitude, while the prevailing tone of the day calls for peace and balance. Try to maintain an equal amount of give and take. There's enough love to go around. Don't feel like you need to be possessive in order to maintain others' loyalty.",Libra
"Dec 14, 2022 - Try not to be too arrogant today, Libra, even when you're utterly sure you're right about the given situation. More than likely, you have the correct answers, but it isn't necessary to be strident about it. Unexpected events are coming your way, and you may find that someone is toying with your emotions. Be on guard for people who may want to ruffle your feathers.",Libra
"Dec 15, 2022 - The earlier portion of the day is apt to flow much more smoothly than the later part, Libra. You should get things solidified right off the bat, if possible. Things will be a bit more relaxed and free flowing in the morning, but become a bit more restrictive as the evening sets in. Don't go to bed without making a plan for what you want to accomplish over the next few days.",Libra
"Dec 16, 2022 - Give it a rest today, Libra. Recharge your batteries. Stick close to home and take a load off your feet. Convince someone to give you a massage, or better yet, go to a professional. You deserve a break. Once you're restored, consider all the ramifications of whatever actions you take before you start. Plan your moves carefully. Be strong and decisive not rash and frantic.",Libra
"Dec 17, 2022 - Things should flow extremely well for you, Libra. Load your engine with extra fuel, because you will be burning red hot. Don't let anything stand in your way. By all means, fight for what you need. There's a great deal of power behind your emotions, and you will find that the intensity of your feelings is real and courageous whether you're laughing or crying.",Libra
"Dec 18, 2022 - You can't spend all your time running from one activity to the next, Libra. You need to take a break from time to time. You have all the energy you need, but you should think about relaxing yourself as a whole. Your body may need its batteries recharged. Pretty soon you will be in the thick of the action and you will need all the energy you can get.",Libra
"Dec 19, 2022 - Today's planetary positions urge you to assert yourself, Libra, but take care not to take this encouragement too far. You tend to go a bit overboard when making a point. There are times (and this is one) when subtlety is more powerful. Try being low key and open rather than uptight and defensive. You have a warm personality, so why not let others experience it?",Libra
"Dec 20, 2022 - Today you will be able to explore the power of your emotions. Don't try and fight what you call your ""oversensitivity."" A force from childhood will permeate you and help you to find out what your real needs are. Shouldn't you think about staying away from people who influence you a little too much? Think about it and go with your emotions.",Libra
"Dec 21, 2022 - Listen to what other people say to you today, Libra. There are valuable experiences waiting around the corner. The important thing to do now is recognize opportunities when they arise. The road to success isn't always well marked. Take a chance on the road with no signs at all. You have the courage and pioneering spirit to pursue the adventurous route, so go for it.",Libra
"Dec 22, 2022 - You may feel a bit sluggish today, Libra. Your warrior spirit would rather stay home on the couch than get up and fight. This is fine. You may simply need a break from your quest for world domination. Remember that a good leader also takes the time to sit back and reflect on recent events in order to make better plans for the future.",Libra
"Dec 23, 2022 - There's a carefree, almost childlike atmosphere to today that suits you just fine, Libra. You've been working extraordinarily hard lately and need to relax and unwind a bit. This is a day for doing cartwheels across an open field. You aren't the only one who feels this way - it's positively contagious. Make the most of this wonderful feeling. This is a day for play not work.",Libra
"Dec 24, 2022 - Get excited because this is going to be one great day! Everything will go your way. It will seem as if you simply can't lose. At work, team members look to you as the leader. At home, family members express gratitude and affection. You may be tempted to try this luck at the casino, but don't be impulsive. You're already a winner. You've earned this shining moment.",Libra
"Dec 25, 2022 - Now isn't the time to prove to people that you're the boss, Libra. They would surely become defensive. You're much better off taking a sensitive, nurturing approach on a day like today. Focus your fire internally and use it to drive your own engine. Don't run over anyone else in the process or try to run their engine for them.",Libra
"Dec 26, 2022 - There's a lethargic pace to the day that might leave you frustrated, Libra. It may seem as if things aren't progressing as quickly as you'd like. Don't be seduced by the idea that everything needs to get done sooner. Faster isn't necessarily better. Focus on quality and efficiency. Examine what could be considered wasteful action. Streamline your daily routine.",Libra
"Dec 27, 2022 - You tend to think of yourself as a lone warrior, Libra. Today your efforts over the last few weeks pay off. You've found your place in a group of people. You may even call it a family. You now have a place to come home to, whether it's to celebrate your victories or lick your wounds. If you could just open up to other people, you'd soon find that you have more than one safe haven.",Libra
"Dec 28, 2022 - It's time to take some time out of your busy day for your personal life, Libra. One of your family members or friends may need to talk to you, and you need to listen attentively to what they have to say. You need to use all your wonderful energy to get down to the heart of the matter. Who knows? You may discover some hidden treasures along the way.",Libra
"Dec 29, 2022 - The planetary aspects are going to have a big impact on you today, Libra. This isn't the time to fear the future. Rather, it's a time to make it happen. The action you take right now will be instrumental in your future. Will there be enough of us walking toward the future? Libra will be at the head of the pack in any case, as always.",Libra
"Dec 30, 2022 - There's a need for decisive action today, Libra, and you're the one fit for the job. Strong wills and forceful opinions will win out. Others aren't likely to be easily manipulated. Everyone has a voice, and they won't be afraid to use it. Make sure that you speak up on your behalf or your best interests may be lost. Stand up for yourself. It's now or never.",Libra
"Dec 31, 2022 - You may feel a bit lazy and unmotivated today, Libra. It could be hard to drag yourself out of bed. In terms of love and romance, there's apt to be some tension, as one part of you wants to make plans while another part is feeling up in the air and in the clouds. These two different viewpoints might make it difficult to make a move in any one direction.",Libra
"Feb 4, 2023 - Computers and other equipment could go haywire today, limiting your abilities to work at maximum efficiency. Even though you're usually calm and laid back, Scorpio, today the ogre in you may be tempted to emerge. Don't let it. It will only cause tension between you and those around you. Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio

Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio
"Feb 4, 2022 - Today should go well for you, Scorpio. Expect to feel a renewed energy and perspective on things, especially those that are work related. Make the most of this by working toward finishing projects that are waiting for you or by cleaning and organizing your desk or broom closet. Feel confident that you'll be able to handle most any task in no time. When everything you wanted to get done is taken care of, make some plans for a little recreation. You deserve it.",Scorpio
"Feb 5, 2022 - Today may well find you in the mood to head out on a venture or visit someone, Scorpio. When was the last time you took a day for something like this? Chances are it's been too long. Not only will you enjoy it but others will be thrilled to have some time with you as well. Whether you pack up the whole family or head out on your own, seize the opportunity to visit a new place or connect with people you haven't seen in a while.",Scorpio
"Feb 6, 2022 - Chances are good that you'll be keeping yourself busy today, Scorpio. The energetic aspects that are occurring can really have you raring to take on chores that need to be done. Can you think of anything you'd rather do? Well, OK, but once you've finished these things, there should be plenty of time to do something recreational, too. Make the most of this great day to get into both work and play.",Scorpio
"Feb 7, 2022 - Another person will probably bring you much comfort today, Scorpio. It could be someone you know well, but chances are it will be someone you’d least expect to be there for you. With your tendency to keep to yourself and be on the quiet side, you may not always notice those around you. Yet this doesn't mean that they don't notice you. Embrace a new friend and the support offered when the opportunity arises.",Scorpio
"Feb 8, 2022 - A renewed sense of values and integrity may be present for you today, Scorpio. Connecting with this can be extremely uplifting, as it can put everything into perspective for you. With your hardworking tendencies, it can be easy to drift from the things that are most important to you as a person. Make the most of this day by getting in touch with yourself. If you keep a journal, explore your mood on paper.",Scorpio
"Feb 9, 2022 - An increased level of physical and mental energy could have you feeling especially determined and highly motivated to move ahead with whatever means the most to you at this time, Scorpio. Matters involving home and family might need some attention right now, though in a very positive way. You'll notice that your inner power is much higher than usual today, as if you could move mountains. Go for it!",Scorpio
"Feb 10, 2022 - Some traumas, phobias, or hang-ups from the past that have been limiting you in some way could suddenly come to the surface today, Scorpio. You might get the most insight by analyzing your dreams. The release could be so profound that you have to spend some time alone today, perhaps away from the house, in order to fully grasp it all. At the end of the day you should feel elated because you'll now see your way toward getting past some of your obstacles.",Scorpio
"Feb 11, 2022 - An upcoming visit from someone close may have you working overtime in order to fix up your house, Scorpio. Therefore, you could be tempted to go crazy buying decorative items. This is fine up to a point, but be careful! Some of the stuff that looks good in the store might not look quite the same once you get it home. Your guest is more interested in seeing you. Decorate in moderation, and have fun doing it!",Scorpio
"Feb 12, 2022 - You’ll find that a sensitive mind that’s open to everything and every possibility is exactly the thing you need at this time in order to be successful in reaching all the goals you’re working toward, Scorpio. You’ll find that your sense of duty and need for plans and solid goals are key elements for getting to where you need to be. Gather information and create a plan of attack that is well thought out.",Scorpio
"Feb 13, 2022 - Rumors may be circulating today, Scorpio, which could cause a certain panic. Some of your friends and colleagues could be calling you at home to discuss the matter. However, these rumors are probably based on little more than gossip, so don't take them seriously. Someone could have an axe to grind and tend to blow things all out of proportion. Try not to engage in this gossip. Stay calm and let your callers know that, for you, the best strategy seems to be to wait for the situation to grow clearer. That should get you through.",Scorpio
"Feb 14, 2022 - You've worked hard to promote your business interests, Scorpio, and today it might pay off. Money, or contracts promising it, could come your way, as well as new opportunities to pursue success, perhaps in writing, teaching, or publishing. Friends and family members should be as excited as you are, and perhaps you'll want to have a celebration of some sort. Relax for a while and enjoy your evening. You'll be back at your tasks soon enough. You can count on it!",Scorpio
"Feb 15, 2022 - A business or love partner could bring opportunities for advancement your way today, Scorpio. You may decide to draft or execute legal papers that could be very important to your future. Travel might somehow be involved. Romance looks promising today. Your confidence and enthusiasm are showing in your face and could make you seem more attractive than usual, both to your partner and strangers. In the evening, plan an intimate celebration!",Scorpio
"Feb 16, 2022 - Minor difficulties over money could put you in a state of frustration. The problems aren’t Earthshaking, but they still need to be handled and could take up a lot of time that you’d rather spend doing something else. Giving in to your frustration could waste more time than simply handling the situation and moving on, however. Try to keep your cool, Scorpio. Take your problems in both hands, resolve them, and move on.",Scorpio
"Feb 17, 2022 - Some wonderful news concerning money and career matters could come your way today, Scorpio. Your natural kindness and sympathy for others has led you to make some good friends who are also valuable business contacts. This is definitely paying off. Your aesthetic sense is at an all-time high, so this is a great day to start any creative projects that you have in mind. Success is definitely coming your way!",Scorpio
"Feb 18, 2022 - Someone you work with might need a sympathetic shoulder to cry on today, Scorpio. Stresses on the job extend beyond everyone's capacity to endure, so don't be surprised if at some point a colleague sheds a few tears. You might find your patience pushed beyond its normal limits. On days like this it's best to work as quickly as you can, stay focused, and go for a drink after you leave work. Then have a nice walk home!",Scorpio
"Feb 19, 2022 - Financial considerations could delay the start of a new project that you’ve wanted to begin for a long time, Scorpio. Perhaps you don't quite have the funds you need, or maybe the cost is a bit higher than you expected. Don't sink into despair. This is only another temporary delay. Tighten the budget and make substitutions. Use your innate ingenuity to work around it and the project should be right on schedule.",Scorpio
"Feb 20, 2022 - This definitely isn’t a good day to stay home and do household chores, Scorpio. If you do, some sad and rather irrational thoughts may plague you throughout the day. No matter what the weather's like, it would be far better to get out and do anything that keeps your mind focused on something positive. Go shopping, attend a sports event, see a movie, or visit a friend. Whatever you do, get your mind off yourself. Go enjoy your day.",Scorpio
"Feb 21, 2022 - Today, or rather tonight, is for romance and cozy intimacy, Scorpio. You pull out all the stops for your evening with that special someone. Scented candles, your best perfume, and your most sensuous clothing work to enchant the person who is already head over heels in love with you. Your relationship is clicking along just beautifully right now. Why not celebrate in some special way?",Scorpio
"Feb 22, 2022 - Change, even when it's for the better, can sometimes be a little scary, Scorpio. You could feel some hesitation about taking a new job or upgrading your home. Nevertheless, you’re being given a terrific opportunity. If you don't seize it, you’ll likely regret it for the rest of your life. What's occurring is for the best, so stretch your arms up high and reach for that brass ring!",Scorpio
"Feb 23, 2022 - This morning you might look in the mirror and be horrified at what you see, Scorpio. You've been working hard and are stressed out, so you probably look tired. You're apt to blow it all out of proportion, however, and think you look a lot worse than you actually do. Treat yourself to some new clothes and a walk, and then get some rest. Tomorrow you'll probably look as terrific as ever. Hang in there.",Scorpio
"Feb 24, 2022 - A new relationship is likely to form soon, and it will probably be with someone who’s already in your life. Perhaps it’s someone you knew in high school and you just recently got back in touch with, or perhaps a colleague at work suddenly begins to pay you a lot of attention. Romance is definitely in the air today, Scorpio, so keep your eyes open for subtle cues from the people in your life.",Scorpio
"Feb 25, 2022 - Colleagues may be a bit on edge, Scorpio. You'll have to choose your words carefully. If you feel as though you’re walking on eggshells, you are. There’s definite tension in the air. And while you can't identify the source, you can certainly see it manifested on the faces of your co-workers. Today wouldn’t be a good day to offer constructive criticism of any kind. Don't rock the boat.",Scorpio
"Feb 26, 2022 - In an unpleasant situation, your inclination is to protect your loved ones from the truth. This would be a mistake, Scorpio. Even though you're acting out of love, your family members deserve to know the truth even if it hurts. You can't shield them from the realities of the outside world. Most people, even the young, prefer to know the facts.",Scorpio
"Feb 27, 2022 - You could soon receive news of an unexpected cash inflow, Scorpio. This might be money earned on your own, but it's more likely to be investment income. If you own stocks, bonds, or land, expect their value to skyrocket. If you work for a company that has a good profit-sharing plan, don't be surprised if the amount of profits earned this year doubles. Whichever it is, you're on your way!",Scorpio
"Feb 28, 2022 - You can't help but feel a bit frustrated today, Scorpio. There are places to go, people to see, and you can't seem to get out of the house. Your responsibilities are at home now, and the situation won't change for a while. You can, however, plan some mini-vacations without too much effort. Treat yourself one evening to fantastic take-out food and a sappy old movie. That might be just the thing to lift your spirits.",Scorpio
"Feb 4, 2023 - Computers and other equipment could go haywire today, limiting your abilities to work at maximum efficiency. Even though you're usually calm and laid back, Scorpio, today the ogre in you may be tempted to emerge. Don't let it. It will only cause tension between you and those around you. Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio

Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio
"Mar 1, 2022 - Setbacks on the job might have you a little depressed and worried. Don't worry, Scorpio; all will be well. Think of this as a challenge to overcome. Your natural practicality and efficiency will see you through. Someone isn't being totally honest with you. Encourage people around you to open up and communicate a little. What they say may not be all that agreeable, but at least you'll be better able to assess the situation.",Scorpio
"Mar 2, 2022 - The information coming at you today may be clouded and delusional, Scorpio. Take it with a grain of salt. Someone could try to pull the wool over your eyes. Check the bus schedule twice before hopping on board. You could find yourself lost in the wrong part of town otherwise. Have patience and try not to get too upset if you aren't receiving the answers you want. The truth will come out soon enough.",Scorpio
"Mar 3, 2022 - The energy that has propelled you forward for the past several weeks might seem to lag a bit today, causing you momentary panic that your progress won't continue. As a result, you could be feeling a bit blue. Don't fall into this trap, Scorpio. The pace has been so fast that it had to slow down sometime. It will pick up again, and you'll have had time to catch your breath. Hang in there!",Scorpio
"Mar 4, 2022 - A lot of effort, energy, and enthusiasm that you've put into various business or personal projects in the past could finally pay off today. Don't be surprised if you receive some unexpected praise or acknowledgement for your work. Friends and your special someone are likely to be very proud of you for this, Scorpio, so don't be surprised if you receive a lot of compliments and congratulations. Go out and celebrate tonight!",Scorpio
"Mar 5, 2022 - Be more adventurous than usual, Scorpio. Feel free to take a trip somewhere without bringing a map or having any specific destination in mind. The sheer excitement of the unknown should thrill and enthuse you, not frighten and confuse. Your enjoyment of the situation has to do with your attitude toward it. You may not be able to control the hand you're dealt, but you can certainly control how you play it.",Scorpio
"Mar 6, 2022 - Your sensual nature is heightened, Scorpio, and you'll find yourself engaged in tender moments and languid peacefulness in the company of others. Soothe your soul by letting yourself slip into situations that give you the emotional freedom to do or say whatever comes to mind. Life should be like a love poem written by a great master. Accept the good energy that comes your way.",Scorpio
"Mar 7, 2022 - You could feel like you're walking a puppy that won't heel, Scorpio. The puppy is curious and, at times, rather reckless. It doesn't know about the dangers of cars or a twisted leash. You have a great responsibility to teach this dog some lesson, while at the same time giving it a bit of freedom to go out and explore alone. Earn the respect of others by tempering discipline with fun.",Scorpio
"Mar 8, 2022 - While you are Earthy by nature and enjoy physical passion, Scorpio, this might seem even more pronounced today. Racy novels and movies could be especially appealing. You may want to plan a romantic evening with a lover. If you don't have one, don't be surprised if an old friend suddenly looks very sexy! This is a great day to shop for clothes. You're more likely to pick the most becoming items.",Scorpio
"Mar 9, 2022 - Today is a very high-energy day in which you have the physical stamina to accomplish quite a bit, Scorpio. Take care, however, that you have all the necessary facts before you venture out for your day's activities. It could be that there is a hidden force working, perhaps within your own mind, to blur the lines of reality about a certain issue. Check your sources and proceed with caution.",Scorpio
"Mar 10, 2022 - Your energy is likely to operate in extreme bursts, Scorpio. One minute you may be lethargic and the next you're ready to run a marathon. Engage in activities that nurture your fluctuating moods. There's no need to figure out why you feel this way. The key is to identify these feelings and act accordingly. Plan how you want to use your energy when it does come. Misdirected action may prove harmful.",Scorpio
"Mar 11, 2022 - Think of today as a restorative time for yourself in which you can come to a point of greater ease and comfort, Scorpio. Trust yourself and the people around you. Open your eyes to the reality of the situation at hand. If you're currently working through some major life changes, have faith that whatever happens will work out to your benefit.",Scorpio
"Mar 12, 2022 - Be careful of getting into fights today, Scorpio. However, if a squabble or altercation of some sort seems inevitable, don't shrink away and hide. It's important that you face the source of the attack and stand up to whomever or whatever is getting in your path. Conjure up the warrior inside you and you might surprise yourself with the incredible power you have within.",Scorpio
"Mar 13, 2022 - Vivid, wonderful dreams may have haunted your sleep last night, Scorpio, leaving you disappointed that they weren't real. They have a message for you, so write them down, set them aside, and analyze them later. Your psychic abilities and imagination are very sharp today. This is a great day to start an artistic project that has been in the back of your mind for some time. Enjoy your day.",Scorpio
"Mar 14, 2022 - Emotions will run high with today's planetary energies, Scorpio. But this is no reason to run away and hide! People will be much more honest than usual, even brutally so, and you could learn some valuable information as a result. Don't be afraid to listen to some airing of dirty laundry as well. With your discerning judgment, you'll be able to make sense of what is good information and what isn't.",Scorpio
"Mar 15, 2022 - Although it looks as if the next few months should shape up to be a great time for your career, Scorpio, unfortunately, today it might appear hopeless. Mundane, routine, unrewarding tasks could take up a lot of your time on the job today. Nevertheless, don't let the frustration interfere with your outlook for the future. You're due for advancement in some way!",Scorpio
"Mar 16, 2022 - You may find that your heart is bouncing back and forth like a tennis ball today, Scorpio. One minute you could be drawn one way, while the next minute you're drawn in a completely different direction. Instead of trying to fight this feeling, take advantage of it. Consciously or unconsciously, what you're really doing is exploring. Try new things until you're sure that you've found what you need.",Scorpio
"Mar 17, 2022 - Travel that is possibly related to business could come up for you, Scorpio. A friend or colleague may accompany you. Expect the unexpected where your career is concerned. Unusual developments may open new doors so you can pursue different goals. You might want to take a course of some kind for pleasure or advancement. Your mind is especially sharp, so you're likely to retain whatever you study now.",Scorpio
"Mar 18, 2022 - You might feel as if your heart is playing tricks on you today, Scorpio. Perhaps you're coming up against a strong force that's causing you to doubt yourself in some way. Don't be conned by loud, obnoxious talk. Seek the true meaning behind the words. You'll find that most of your strength is internal. Be prepared for stubborn wills to make a powerful presence in your world today.",Scorpio
"Mar 19, 2022 - Too much stress and strain over the past few days could cause you to clash with your partner. While not a disaster by any means, Scorpio, this can put a damper on your day. It might be best if you took a few minutes to get away by yourself and let all your negativity fade away when no one's around. You'll feel better by the time you face your family, friends, and partner again.",Scorpio
"Mar 20, 2022 - It may not be easy for you to convince someone today. No matter how profound your idea or how convincing your explanations, the other person just isn't ready to believe it yet. Don't be pushy. Maybe this person needs to sleep on it for a couple of nights, or maybe they just need to do their own research. Be patient and focus on other things in the meantime!",Scorpio
"Mar 21, 2022 - You could feel a lot of fond affection for everyone around you today, even those you normally might find irritating. Co-workers, friends, family, and the special person in your life are likely to be happier for having basked in this glow, and should reciprocate. You're feeling especially generous, Scorpio, so buying gifts is likely to be on your agenda. Don't forget to be kind to yourself, too.",Scorpio
"Mar 22, 2022 - Studying in solitude may appeal to you today, Scorpio. A new interest has captured your imagination, so you may decide to sequester yourself at home or in the library to learn about it. Your concentration is high, as is your perseverance, so anything you begin today is likely to succeed. The downside is that you might strain your eyes or give yourself headaches trying to accomplish too much at once. Pace yourself.",Scorpio
"Mar 23, 2022 - Do you like detective stories, Scorpio? If so, you may find them useful today as you play the role of Sherlock Holmes. A missing object, intellectual problem, or mystery of some kind could have you curious enough to search for the truth. This is a good way to train your powers of observation, although intuition will probably play a strong role in your success. Go to it, and have fun!",Scorpio
"Mar 24, 2022 - Communication with partners is likely to be poor to nonexistent today, Scorpio. This isn't the time to enter into contract negotiations or other discussions that could affect your future in a major way. The prevailing mood is down, so whatever you decide today is apt to reflect that mood. It might be best to wait a few days until everyone is in a more positive frame of mind. Hang in there!",Scorpio
"Mar 25, 2022 - Dreams or visions could bring sudden and exciting insights with regard to career issues, Scorpio. These dreams could steer you toward books, websites, and other sources of information that can provide further guidance that could well prove invaluable. The source of your insights may be rather unorthodox, but don't write them off because of that. Think of them as messages from your higher self and make the most of them.",Scorpio
"Mar 26, 2022 - This may be a tricky day, Scorpio, as you feel the pull of conflicting demands and desires. On the one hand, you feel obligated to your career and fulfilling the demands of your employer. On the other, your loved ones miss you and would like to have you around more. There's no easy answer, although you might want to consider ways to delegate more work so you can spend more time with your loved ones.",Scorpio
"Mar 27, 2022 - Has the perfect career suddenly materialized out of nowhere, Scorpio? If so, don't write it off as being too good to be true. It's very, very real! Take a few days to consider all your options and all possible contingencies. Talk to people who know the ins and outs of the field. If everything seems favorable, go for it. Such an opportunity may not come around again for a long time.",Scorpio
"Mar 28, 2022 - This is a great day to deal with legal matters of any kind, Scorpio, including plans for a wedding, if one is in the offing! Your financial situation should be thriving and stable, and long-term educational goals may come to the forefront. Now you should be strongly focused on matters that are particularly important to you. Work performed today toward those ends should be accomplished quickly and efficiently. Go to it!",Scorpio
"Mar 29, 2022 - If you're involved in the arts, Scorpio, expect today to hear about an opportunity to exhibit your work publicly. There should be a very positive reaction to it, so you can expect a lot of compliments and ego-boosts. An opportunity to earn some money from your work could also come along. Don't turn it down out of shyness or insecurity. Go for the gold. This trend is likely to continue, so make the most of it.",Scorpio
"Mar 30, 2022 - Idealized romantic feelings could pour out today when talking to your love interest, Scorpio. That's fine, but you should exercise restraint. If it's a new relationship, your partner could be scared off. If it's a long-term involvement, your friend might feel at a disadvantage. Channel the feelings into a poem, song, or painting. If you must voice them directly to your friend, keep the terms general. Don't put your beloved on the spot.",Scorpio
"Mar 31, 2022 - Money matters could have you descending into a state of pure gloom, Scorpio. On the surface it might seem like you'll never be able to sort through all the paperwork, but you will. Don't give up. Stay focused on the task and take one step at a time. Before you know it, your efficiency and practicality should have it sorted out and behind you. Cheer up, and plan a great evening!",Scorpio
"Apr 1, 2022 - Your thinking is solid and clear today, Scorpio, but other people could challenge your mental power. Don't let others put seeds of doubt in your head about the way you approach a problem. Keep your mind open to alternative solutions, but don't beat yourself up for your current mental track. You might need to modify your strategy, but don't sacrifice your principles or values.",Scorpio
"Apr 2, 2022 - You could hesitate to take the initiative, Scorpio. Instead, you'd rather wait and see how things pan out before you make a major move. Your movements are hindered in some way, although you may not be sure why. It's best to go with your intuition and not question too much. Just know that you're better off taking the safer route rather than walking too far out on the thin ice.",Scorpio
"Apr 3, 2022 - Although you generally like to keep both feet on the ground and proceed in a stable, organized manner, Scorpio, there's a strong force encouraging you to spread your wings. Incorporate more fantasy into your day, and practice the art of dreaming. Liberate yourself from reality for a while and feel the weight lifted from your shoulders. Let your imagination run wild. This will bring a greater sense of balance to your life.",Scorpio
"Apr 4, 2022 - This is a day to think about your private life, Scorpio. Expect to be particularly sensitive to all kinds of demands from those close to you. You have the power to create greater harmony at home, specifically in your relationship. Take stock of everyone's desires and consider any limitations in fulfilling them. Even if the answers aren't found today, it will be useful to simply ask the questions.",Scorpio
"Apr 5, 2022 - Like your compatriots, Scorpio, something is coming to an end concerning the lack of confidence you have in yourself. You have been hesitant to stand in the spotlight for quite a while now, feeling you aren't quite ready. Well, no more excuses! Ready or not, you're going to have to push forward. The only thing you risk losing is your pride, and that, Scorpio, is your most resilient asset.",Scorpio
"Apr 6, 2022 - Today you could receive a lucky career break of some kind that brings some extra money your way, Scorpio. The downside is that you might have to put in many extra hours. Your good fortune could cause temporary problems in your personal life. Your significant other and family members could be disgruntled. Point out that it may be inconvenient now, but everyone will be better off in the long run.",Scorpio
"Apr 7, 2022 - You always tend to have good powers of concentration, Scorpio, but today you're more focused than usual, probably on a project that means a lot to you. This could be job related, it might involve helping a friend, or it may just be a personal project. Whatever it is, you should accomplish a lot today. The downside is that you might forget to eat, sleep, or take any breaks. Take care!",Scorpio
"Apr 8, 2022 - A strong desire to meet with a romantic partner could come over you today, Scorpio. However, you might not be able to reach your friend. He or she could be busy and unable to respond to phone messages or emails. Nonetheless, don't get too frustrated. If you persist, the two of you will eventually touch base. If you can't see each other today, make arrangements for tomorrow. Better late than never!",Scorpio
"Apr 9, 2022 - You might have planned to make a particular purchase today, Scorpio, but a quick check of your financial situation could reveal that it would be better if you waited until your next payday. This could prove disappointing and frustrating, but look at it this way - you've waited this long for this item. It isn't urgent, so waiting a little longer certainly won't hurt. Do something else today.",Scorpio
"Apr 10, 2022 - Your outlook is apt to be optimistic, enthusiastic, and practical, Scorpio! You have both creative and workable ideas. They're likely to lead to success, although it could take considerable time and effort to make it happen. Communication with colleagues is likely to be open, honest, and very dynamic as projects and enterprises take on a life of their own. Work hard, make it happen, and enjoy the journey!",Scorpio
"Apr 11, 2022 - Career matters couldn't be going better right now, Scorpio, especially if you're in one of the communication fields, including writing, publishing, teaching, the Internet, or mass media. Your financial situation is probably improving very quickly, and you're making contact with congenial, intriguing people who share your interests. You're also becoming more aware of the changes going on in the world and doing your part to help them along. Bravo!",Scorpio
"Apr 12, 2022 - This could be a day of inner turmoil, Scorpio. You'll rethink some of your fundamental values, unsure if they're still relevant to your life. It's clear that some soul searching is needed. There are no right or wrong answers, only what is in your heart. If your goal is to live authentically, then you'll need to make some big changes in your life. Don't act rashly. Think things through before taking steps.",Scorpio
"Apr 13, 2022 - A lack of communication on the part of your mate or perhaps a business partner can cause you to feel uncertainty about the relationship. Don't fall into this trap, Scorpio. Use your warmth and understanding to open up the communication between you. You'll probably find that all is basically well. Your partner just needs some space. Take some space for yourself, too! A little solitude might do you some good.",Scorpio
"Apr 14, 2022 - You could be invited on a last-minute adventure today, Scorpio. By all means, seize the chance! You're certainly ready for a change, and this opportunity could turn out to be just what you've been hoping for.

"Apr 15, 2022 - Cool heads will be needed today, Scorpio, as tempers may flare at work because of frustration with ongoing problems. You might need to take the lead in keeping everyone calm by facilitating clear and open communication. It will be important to keep emotions in check or words will fly that people may regret. This is a temporary situation. Everyone should be back on an even keel as soon as issues get properly aired.",Scorpio
"Apr 16, 2022 - You can overcome the intensity of today's planetary energies by making a conscious effort stay positive, Scorpio. Distract yourself with necessary household chores and errands. Don't forget to take some time out for fun, too. As you work around the house, stop to indulge yourself every few hours. A cup of hot chocolate or a chat on the phone will add a welcome grace note to the day.",Scorpio
"Apr 17, 2022 - You're eager and optimistic today, Scorpio, which works well with your strong, capable nature. You're likely to find that things begin to click into place at work. Something that has been troubling you for some time suddenly becomes clear. What was once a stumbling block is now a mere bump in the road and easily overcome. All indications are that you'll be successful at whatever you do now, so dare to dream big.",Scorpio
"Apr 18, 2022 - This is likely to be a day geared to fulfilling the needs of family. Lesser persons would resent the obligation, but not you, Scorpio. You have a nurturing spirit. As long as you feel appreciated, you're happy to go the extra mile (or two). You can expect to feel loved by those around you. You have a willing, giving nature, and it shows in your aura like a beacon for all to see.",Scorpio
"Apr 19, 2022 - Use the power of words as an artistic medium to express yourself, Scorpio. You have a magic way with words that often goes unrecognized. Your sensual nature is poetic. You shouldn't deprive others of this talent, so show it off to the world. Perhaps you're moved to write a love poem to a partner who means a great deal to you. As trite as this may sound, it's actually very romantic.",Scorpio
"Apr 20, 2022 - Communication could take some extra effort today, Scorpio. A business or romantic partner could seem like they're keeping things from you. You might get some uneasy vibes and wonder if there's trouble with your partnership. Don't be afraid to ask. Your friend probably won't tell you what the problem is, but will reassure you that it has nothing to do with you. If so, it isn't your business. Let it go.",Scorpio
"Apr 21, 2022 - Financial good fortune continues, Scorpio, although old habits are hard to break and you might have difficulty adjusting to it. You could alternate between wanting to buy out the store and continuing to pinch pennies the way you used to. That's OK. Everybody has to make adjustments in life. Second only to falling in love, this will probably be one of the most pleasant adjustments you'll ever have to make!",Scorpio
"Apr 22, 2022 - Have you been harboring a secret desire for someone you believe thinks of you only as a friend, Scorpio? Don't be surprised if you learn differently today. This is a day when hidden passions may suddenly be revealed - and your friend could unexpectedly divulge a covert attraction to you! The only downside is that sometimes it can be a letdown when fantasies become reality. Take note of your reaction before moving ahead.",Scorpio
"Apr 23, 2022 - This isn't the best day for get-togethers, Scorpio. What starts as a friendly lunch could wind up a gossip-fest. No one wins in that situation. You could fear leaving the table because of what they'd say about you. There's no upside to the situation, so your best strategy might be to stay home and work on chores. At least you'll have the satisfaction of feeling that you've accomplished something.",Scorpio
"Apr 24, 2022 - Difficult as it may be for you to face all those projects you've left undone, Scorpio, know that you'll be free to move on once they're complete. People from your past figure prominently now. Perhaps they come forward to repay an old debt or possibly claim repayment from you. Don't abandon your dreams. Once you've cleared a path for them, they're more likely to come true.",Scorpio
"Apr 25, 2022 - You enjoy reaping rewards for all your efforts. But in your love life, you have to admit that you can never be sure of the quantity or the quality of the fruits of your labors. Yet, today, Scorpio, you could realize that it's time to plant some new seeds. You might not know how they'll turn out, but you do know better than anyone else that you can't win if you don't play.",Scorpio
"Apr 26, 2022 - This could be a frustrating day in the romance department, Scorpio. Communication is blocked at all levels. You're anxious to speak with your loved one, but simply can't reach him or her. Perhaps the phone system is malfunctioning or email is acting up. You feel as though the Universe is conspiring against you. Take heart. Your partner will contact you soon enough, and your reunion will be electric!",Scorpio
"Apr 27, 2022 - Some underhanded and not altogether honest machinations could be happening at the workplace, Scorpio. You could be offended by it, and you could also worry if it threatens your job. Then you might also consider what you're doing there, if it's that sort of organization. These inner conflicts could signify the need to focus on the realities and discern exactly what you want to do. Then go for it.",Scorpio
"Apr 28, 2022 - Relations with colleagues on the job could be very cooperative today, Scorpio, probably because you're about to complete a project of some kind that could result in higher income for everyone. Communication should be open and honest, and for once you'll probably be able to reach everyone you phone without having to leave any messages. Go with the flow and all should be completed successfully. Onward and upward!",Scorpio
"Apr 29, 2022 - A subject you're researching, perhaps for a class or workshop, might prove more difficult than you expected, Scorpio. The resources you consult might be very scholarly and thus difficult to read. If you can't find anything comprehensible, try to rent or buy a video on the subject. It's more important to understand the material than force yourself to approach it in the accepted scholarly manner. It's also important that you enjoy it.",Scorpio
"Apr 30, 2022 - Today's energy will be making you think only about your relationships, Scorpio. It isn't easy to have relationships with others, as you may have noticed. The respective demands of each one in a relationship can be difficult to understand. Moreover, the demands of others can obscure your path or cause you to detour from it. Consider that the less we ask for in a relationship, the more flexible and deeper it becomes!",Scorpio
"Feb 4, 2023 - Computers and other equipment could go haywire today, limiting your abilities to work at maximum efficiency. Even though you're usually calm and laid back, Scorpio, today the ogre in you may be tempted to emerge. Don't let it. It will only cause tension between you and those around you. Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio
"May 1, 2022 - Are you having some problems with authority, Scorpio? Are you having a hard time making yourself understood? If so, have you thought about explaining your projects in detail to the people that you hope will follow you in your adventure? You can't expect others to follow you blindly. They, too, have their lives to live, as well as their own objectives and priorities.",Scorpio
"May 2, 2022 - Issues regarding control of a situation are probably going to be your focus, Scorpio. More than likely, you adhere to a solidly planned routine. You have a set way of doing things and you want to stick to it. Other people are moving into the picture, however, and they may want to take a leadership role. People will be adamant and strong willed when it comes to their facts. You should be, too.",Scorpio
"May 3, 2022 - You might be upset by certain financial matters today, Scorpio. Either you realize just how much you've been spending lately or you see that things will be tight in the months ahead. It's possible you invested a good deal of money in something that could have waited, and now you can't invest in something much more important. These are hard lessons to learn, but everyone learns them some time.",Scorpio
"May 4, 2022 - Today you might find yourself feeling a little low, Scorpio, but it doesn't seem as if there's any real reason for it. You may just have had a bad night and need some extra sleep. Some good news from far away could cheer you up in the afternoon. You might receive an invitation to go out to dinner with a close friend. You should be feeling like your old self again by evening.",Scorpio
"May 5, 2022 - Stimulation that you could receive today from group activities might open doors to a wealth of rich experiences, Scorpio. Your innate organizing talents may be called upon.

An increased ability to concentrate can lead to success with whatever you try to accomplish. Go for it!",Scorpio
"May 6, 2022 - You might feel as if you can't access your physical energy now, Scorpio. You may experience frustration when you try to engage in a sport. You don't feel as if things are clicking into place as easily as they should. This feeling is taking a toll on your sense of self. Don't get down on yourself for feeling this way. Accept the fact that there are good times and not so good times for doing certain things.",Scorpio
"May 7, 2022 - Issues of love and romance should be going well for you, Scorpio, and you'll find that regardless of where you are in your relationships, you're right where you need to be. There's an element of fantasy at work today that's making you much more susceptible to romantic dreams and ideas. The good news is that you have the power to put these dreams into motion. Manifest your wildest fantasies with a loved one tonight.",Scorpio
"May 8, 2022 - You just can't do everything at once, Scorpio. How do you expect to reduce your stress and recuperate while at the same time continue to be a superstar performer in every area of your life? Don't pressure yourself to perform today. If you do, you're likely to deplete your reserves even further. Take it easy, rest, and relax! You've earned this little break.",Scorpio
"May 9, 2022 - You're well aware that your happiness in love doesn't depend on emotional promises alone. In order to attract your attention, anyone new in your life has to make some material offering as well. That's exactly what could happen today. You might receive a gift from someone who has been buzzing around you for some time. Smile, Scorpio. People are finally beginning to catch on.",Scorpio
"May 10, 2022 - There's some likelihood that your heart will flutter as certain plans begin to be realized. If you have your heart set on someone who seems impossibly remote, or you're hoping to transform and improve an existing love relationship, the day ahead will enable you to make strides toward this goal, but not without some mishaps. Be prepared to tackle a crisis or two, Scorpio!",Scorpio
"May 11, 2022 - Be disciplined about all areas of your body, Scorpio. Take extra care to eat healthful, balanced meals. Make sure you get enough sleep. And even though you gripe about having no time, get out there and exercise. Don't wait for an emergency before you take action. You and you alone control how you feel. Your health is essential to your well-being, not to mention your life!",Scorpio
"May 12, 2022 - Contact with friends who live or work far away could bring a string of new opportunities your way. You might also be thinking of taking a trip, perhaps to another country or by boat. An opportunity to attend a seminar of some kind could present itself, possibly through friends. A lot is happening, Scorpio, but try to stay focused. What happens today could be too important to let your mind become muddled.",Scorpio

Meditate on your concept of spirituality and the interconnection of humans and the planet, past and present. Savor the connection you feel.",Scorpio
"May 14, 2022 - Something has to change, Scorpio. You knew it as soon as you woke up this morning. Your mirror provides the impetus for some important resolutions.

"May 22, 2022 - You tend to get quite emotional about things even though you don't always show it prominently to the outside world, Scorpio.

"May 29, 2022 - Social contact may be limited to Zoom conversations and waving to masked strangers on the street, Scorpio, but the factors of risk and reward are still in play.

By taking that risk today, you may be rewarded with a wonderful experience. Either way, you'll be safe and healthy.",Scorpio
"May 30, 2022 - You may not want to admit something today, Scorpio, although you know it's true. It becomes more obvious than you think if you're hiding behind a barrier that has formed between you and someone close to you.

Do something new and different even if others think you're crazy.",Scorpio
"Jun 7, 2022 - You're likely to be feeling especially romantic today, Scorpio. If you're currently involved, plan an intimate evening at home with your lover. If you aren't involved, anything goes.

Don't let the day pass you by.",Scorpio

You deserve to feel proud of what you've achieved.",Scorpio

Romance is in the cards for you tonight.",Scorpio
"Jun 23, 2022 - The fire is raging today, so be careful, Scorpio. Try not to be too impulsive in your actions.

In spite of all the great things in your life, you might find yourself feeling a little blue sometime during the day. Don't read too much into it. It's probably just the result of low biorhythms. Try to distract yourself with work. This evening talk or text with some friends who always cheer you up.",Scorpio

Kick back and reap the rewards of all your hard work.",Scorpio

"Feb 4, 2023 - Computers and other equipment could go haywire today, limiting your abilities to work at maximum efficiency. Even though you're usually calm and laid back, Scorpio, today the ogre in you may be tempted to emerge. Don't let it. It will only cause tension between you and those around you. Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio
"Jul 1, 2022 - The pace of things is likely to slow down a bit compared to what was happening yesterday, Scorpio. This is probably for the best. Take this time to do some planning and stabilizing. You've plowed forth into the fields. Now stop and assess what you've accomplished. Take things one step at a time and don't get ahead of yourself. Be patient and things will come your way naturally.",Scorpio
"Jul 2, 2022 - Take some of that knowledge you've picked up and processed over the past few weeks and spread it around, Scorpio. It's time to put your communication skills to work.

Take deep breaths and release that pent-up tension.",Scorpio
"Jul 3, 2022 - The day's energy is erratic and you're apt to jump all over the place, Scorpio. Don't worry about trying to firm up any plans at this time.

You can always catch another one later if need be.",Scorpio
"Jul 4, 2022 - You could feel like you're being double-crossed by a loved one today, Scorpio. It could be that your own words are being used against you in a way that makes you look like the bad guy.

"Jul 6, 2022 - No one is going to be catering to your needs today, Scorpio, so get up and do things on your own. You'll find that there is little sympathy from others, and strong opinions are a dime a dozen. There's a great deal of gossip buzzing around that you may be tempted to join in on. Don't be an enabler of this sort of behavior. It's only going to alienate you from others in the long run.",Scorpio
"Jul 7, 2022 - Make practical use of the thoughts you have synthesized over the last few days, Scorpio. Stretch your boundaries and extend your wisdom to the people around you.

Security and grounding are key themes of the day.",Scorpio
"Jul 9, 2022 - Other people's stubborn attitudes may be hindering your progress, Scorpio. Take this as a hint that you need to loosen your grip on a certain viewpoint that you're holding too tightly. There's a great deal of power behind your emotions today, and these emotions want to be heard. Feel free to jump up and take the podium. Speak your mind even though you may not necessarily agree with the group.",Scorpio
"Jul 10, 2022 - Daydreams about your future could take up a lot of time today, Scorpio. Inspiration could give a real boost to projects you've been working on. These might involve artistic endeavors or perhaps some sprucing up that you want to do around the house and yard. Working together, if possible, might bring you closer to friends, family members, and possibly a love partner. Conversations with them could take an unexpected turn.",Scorpio
"Jul 11, 2022 - You've reached an emotionally climactic point right now, Scorpio, and you could find some harsh opposition coming at you for no apparent reason. There is a stubborn, strong, oppressive force today, and you should be aware that the more rigid your viewpoint, the harder it will be for any resolution at all. Compromise is an essential virtue of the day.",Scorpio
"Jul 12, 2022 - Be a little braver than usual today, Scorpio. Take some risks and show others that you have the strength to accomplish anything. There is a lively, anxious feeling to the day that could make you restless. This energy is encouraging you to get up and get going. Initiate something rather than wait for someone else to take the lead. Don't be afraid to fail. You'll never succeed if you don't try.",Scorpio
"Jul 13, 2022 - Paperwork involving financial transactions may need to be handled today, Scorpio, but it won't be as tedious as you think. Whatever information is required is easily obtained. Most of what is presented to you should be clear and understandable, and the people involved helpful. It's important that you do get this done. If you wait, it might not go as smoothly. In the evening, schedule a romantic encounter, if possible. Your level of passion is rather high!",Scorpio

You might also want to fix yourself up and plan a romantic evening!",Scorpio
"Jul 16, 2022 - This kind of strange day doesn't occur often, Scorpio. You no longer seem to know what you want. Work or time off? Redecorate your house or live in a beach shack? It's hard to communicate because you feel it's pointless to try to explain your point of view, especially when you don't know what it is. The best thing to do may be to unplug from your usual activities and go for a walk. This confusion will pass.",Scorpio
"Jul 17, 2022 - New opportunities, perhaps involving writing or speaking, could appear on the horizon along with the current planetary energy, Scorpio.

The important thing is to embrace today and make the most of the time and love you have now.",Scorpio
"Jul 20, 2022 - You could find it harder than usual to wake up this morning, Scorpio, as your energy may be flagging. Personal or professional pressures might stir feelings of futility, but don't fall into this trap. In spite of your momentary lethargy, everything on the horizon looks far better than it seems - primarily because of your own hard work. Retire early tonight and tomorrow you'll feel more energetic.",Scorpio
"Jul 21, 2022 - There is solid grounding to your emotions right now that is helping you stabilize your sensitive feelings, Scorpio. As you become more attuned to your internal needs, you may discover that recent actions in romance and love may not have been particularly appropriate.

"Jul 24, 2022 - There's likely to be a powerful force at work trying to manipulate the way you think about a certain situation, Scorpio. Be conscious of the source of your facts. It could be that someone is giving you tainted information so you'll act in a way that is favorable to his or her plan. Others may not be looking out for your best interests, so it's important that you are. Don't accept things blindly without question.",Scorpio
"Jul 25, 2022 - You're apt to come up with some new, radical thoughts today, Scorpio, which you should feel free to share with others. There are opportunities around that you should grab hold of. Be aggressive about pushing ahead with your progressive thoughts. Communication with people who possess opposing viewpoints will prove quite valuable. Take a lesson from the bizarre and outlandish.",Scorpio
"Jul 26, 2022 - People might be a bit argumentative when it comes to romantic issues today, Scorpio.

Maintain your internal power by celebrating your uniqueness instead of your need to show off your daredevil spirit.",Scorpio
"Jul 30, 2022 - You're incredibly productive, with good business sense, Scorpio. However, lately you may have felt dissatisfied with where you are in life. As you look around, you might wish you had more possessions to show for all your hard work. Don't pursue this line of thought. Real value comes from relationships and the pride you get from doing a job well. A new car or fancy clothes may lift your spirits, but it's superficial.",Scorpio
"Jul 31, 2022 - If you follow your instincts and dare to take some risks, Scorpio, you'll be handsomely rewarded. You have the capability to make a good project great.

"Aug 1, 2022 - Today is a great day to act on things that have been brewing in your brain for quite some time, Scorpio. Perhaps you've been feeling unsure of yourself.

This is a great time to move toward it.",Scorpio

"Aug 3, 2022 - Sticking close to home may leave you feeling like you're missing the boat on certain things, but you're probably better off, Scorpio.

You'll find success your own way.",Scorpio
"Aug 4, 2022 - Are you waiting to hear some important news, Scorpio? Significant career matters may be involved. This isn't a good day to sit around waiting.

This uncomfortable feeling could turn into nervousness, restlessness, and eventually anger. Don't feel like you need to be the one to make any sacrifices at this time.",Scorpio
"Aug 6, 2022 - Tempers may get hot today when someone says something that pierces you to your core. Address this problem right away, Scorpio, instead of letting it fester through the rest of the day. The solution requires sensitivity and caring. Let the offender know that he or she has hurt you significantly, if that is indeed the case. There's no need for you to try to hide your feelings.",Scorpio
"Aug 7, 2022 - An unexpected communication may come today from someone connected with your career, Scorpio. This is good news, but it may be so off the wall that you could walk around in a daze for a while trying to make sense of it all. Don't agonize too much. You've worked hard for and deserve whatever it is that's suddenly coming to you. Think of it as a karmic reward. Go celebrate!",Scorpio
"Aug 8, 2022 - Overwork and the resulting stress and nerve strain could result in tension headaches today, Scorpio. It might be a good idea to start the day pacing yourself and concentrating on the most pressing tasks. Don't worry if you have to leave some for later. There's a chance that others around you might get into some rather heated arguments. Stay out of it. This would only make you feel worse.",Scorpio
"Aug 9, 2022 - A letter or call could arrive today bringing upsetting news about money, Scorpio. Your first reaction might be to blame yourself or someone else, but the circumstances are probably beyond anyone's control. Chances are it can be set right.

It seems a celebration is in order!",Scorpio
"Aug 12, 2022 - Your imagination should be flying high today, Scorpio, and your creative juices flowing freely.

Don't be surprised if you find your intuition increasing as well. Make the most of it all and have fun.",Scorpio
"Aug 13, 2022 - Don't be surprised if sometime during the day you feel angry for no apparent reason, Scorpio. It's probably rooted in the past, from a situation that wasn't resolved long ago. Take a good look at what's going on today. Did some person or event awaken old traumas within you? Let them and the anger go. This can only benefit you and clear the way for more positive emotions.",Scorpio
"Aug 14, 2022 - Different people measure success by different scales. You shouldn't get discouraged if your accomplishment today seems small compared to what others have done in the same period. Comparisons will make it difficult for you to feel like you're getting anywhere. Someone else will always do more. Be content with what you do today, even if it's something simple.",Scorpio
"Aug 15, 2022 - Chances are that you'll feel upbeat and positive today. Share this energy with others who feel less than content. Your attitude can have a profound effect on friends, partners, spouse, and children. Neighbors and extended family can pick up on your spirit without you even realizing it. If someone is hurt or angry, be encouraging. Everything will eventually work out.",Scorpio
"Aug 16, 2022 - Today should go well for you, Scorpio. Expect to feel a renewed energy and fresher perspective, especially concerning anything work related.

When everything is taken care of, make plans for a little recreation. You deserve it.",Scorpio
"Aug 17, 2022 - Today may find you in the mood for an adventure or a visit if possible, Scorpio. When was the last time you took a day for something like this? It's probably been too long.

"Aug 18, 2022 - You'll probably be busy today, Scorpio, and this may suit you just fine. This can really work in favor if you have some tasks to catch up on. Being energetic, active, and productive is natural for you. In fact, when you have to sit too long you probably feel restless or anxious. You may fidget, too. If you find yourself doing this, go find something active to do.",Scorpio
"Aug 19, 2022 - Do you recognize your intuition as a valuable asset, Scorpio? Some people do and some don't. Which group are you in? It can be easy to trust more in concrete, factual reality than in the things you can't touch, yet your intuition can serve you more than you may realize. That gut feeling you experience can guide you toward greatness and alert you to danger. Trust it more.",Scorpio
"Aug 20, 2022 - If long-overdue work has piled up, Scorpio, today is the day to dig in. This is especially so for things you weren't able to handle yesterday.

"Aug 23, 2022 - If visitors are able to pop in and out during the day, Scorpio, you'll be in the right frame of mind to enjoy their company. Expect interesting news and stimulating conversation. At the end of the day, your mind may be going like a house afire, so it might be a good idea to take a walk or get some other form of exercise or else you might not be able to sleep.",Scorpio
"Aug 24, 2022 - Today you're apt to feel very sensual and passionate, Scorpio. Sexy clothes, racy novels, and romantic movies could be more appealing than usual.

You'll enjoy it whenever it happens. Better late than never!",Scorpio
"Aug 25, 2022 - If you find yourself in a slump today, Scorpio, don't worry.

This combination could result in a locked-up feeling that keeps you incapable of any movement at all.",Scorpio
"Aug 26, 2022 - The time has come for you to be more flexible in your approach, Scorpio. Things are changing quickly, and if you aren't prepared to change with them, you'll be left behind.

Believe in yourself and move confidently in the direction of your dreams in order to make them come true.",Scorpio
"Aug 28, 2022 - Today you might be so gloomy that you don't even want to get up. It might not be a good idea to stay home, however. Try to find some tasks to distract you. At some point during the day, get out in the open air and take a walk, preferably through a park and near water, if possible. You'll get the endorphins going and lift your spirits considerably.",Scorpio
"Aug 29, 2022 - Today you might crave the companionship of friends and lovers alike, Scorpio. You're probably in the mood for some good food, good music, and great conversation, and that's just what you'll get if it’s possible in any way. Later you might spend time alone with a love partner, reflecting on recent conversations. Some of them might be worthy of deeper thought. Have a pleasant day and a wonderful evening.",Scorpio
"Aug 30, 2022 - You're probably feeling more in touch with your emotions, Scorpio, but it might be difficult to know which way to move based on where you are.

Try to calm down and focus before making any major decisions.",Scorpio
"Aug 31, 2022 - You and your mate may be experiencing some differences of opinion. It seems you each have definite ideas about some of life's fundamental values and they aren't completely in sync.

"Sep 1, 2022 - You may get frustrated today, Scorpio, especially in the morning when other people's egos seem to be strong.

Remain confident in your position despite the vacillation of others.",Scorpio
"Sep 2, 2022 - Today you should feel especially sexy and relationships with romantic partners should go well, Scorpio.

Plan a cozy evening for two. You'll want to do a lot of talking - and more!",Scorpio
"Sep 3, 2022 - An unexpected career break could come your way, Scorpio. It should be exciting and encouraging - and a little scary! Don't let apprehension get to you. You won't want to let this opportunity pass you by. Your good fortune could arouse envy in some of your co-workers, but don't let this bother you either. Simply do what you need to do to get the ball rolling and then go ahead with it.",Scorpio
"Sep 4, 2022 - Feel free to take care of any restructuring in your life that needs to be done now, Scorpio.

"Sep 6, 2022 - Relations with people on the job should be warm, Scorpio, and this could do wonders for your career. Take nothing at face value. All may not be as it seems. Someone has issues with you that render him or her untrustworthy. Take care to avoid getting too close to anyone who seems a little under the weather. Your immune system is a bit weak, and you could catch a bug.",Scorpio
"Sep 7, 2022 - Someone close to you may not be totally honest. This person could be avoiding telling the truth or hiding something from you in order to protect you. Trust your instincts, Scorpio. If someone tells you something important that doesn't ring true, check it out before accepting one person's word. This isn't a vicious deception - only a protective one. But shielding someone from the truth can sometimes backfire!",Scorpio
"Sep 8, 2022 - It might feel like there's a hole in your heart today, Scorpio, and you could have a hard time filling it. Remember that you're the one responsible for making sure this void is taken care of. If you insist that someone else fill the gap, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Do something nice for yourself and feel free to spend a little money to make yourself happy.",Scorpio
"Sep 9, 2022 - Frustration may be the word for today, Scorpio. You could be experiencing a bit of wanderlust. Distant states and foreign lands may beckon to you, but circumstances could make it hard for you to get away. There might also be friction with your partner. Don't get sucked into a quarrel. Use your placid nature to get grounded, then use your practicality to solve the issues at hand.",Scorpio
"Sep 10, 2022 - Prosperity is just around the corner, Scorpio. With it comes change. Change in your job, career, or environment figures prominently today.

Wait a few days and give it some serious thought.",Scorpio
"Sep 13, 2022 - If you've never tried your hand at the arts, Scorpio, this is the day to do it. Your imagination and ingenuity are flying high, and your aesthetic sense is acute right now. If you aren't already involved with such activities, look online to see what classes or workshops are offered. Get a friend to sign up with you. You'll probably have a great time!",Scorpio
"Sep 14, 2022 - You may have a strange paranoia that people are out to get you today, Scorpio, but don't let this feeling paralyze you. Your emotions are more than likely getting the better of you. The reality of the situation is much different than your sensitive emotions perceive. Avoid the tendency to escape even further into this fantasy world. Stay away from drugs or alcohol.",Scorpio
"Sep 15, 2022 - It may be much easier than usual to express your emotions to someone today, Scorpio. If there has been something on your mind for a while, now is the time to say it.

Your sensitivity is a gift that others will recognize and appreciate.",Scorpio

You're also better able to intuit what's going on with them.",Scorpio
"Sep 17, 2022 - Erotic dreams could wake you up in a strange mood, Scorpio. You could long for a romantic encounter, but the impact is likely to be stronger than that. These intense dreams might stimulate your creative juices. If you aren't currently working on a project, ideas could flood your imagination. Let them stew for a while. There's no rush to pick one. Enjoy your day.",Scorpio
"Sep 18, 2022 - Today, a flash of inspiration may resolve an obstacle to your career advancement that presented itself in the past few days, Scorpio.

No one will win the boxing match, so don't even get in the ring.",Scorpio
"Sep 20, 2022 - Information gleaned from surprising sources could lead to sudden, fortunate career breaks, Scorpio. You might explore totally new fields, although this could be temporary.

"Sep 21, 2022 - Your values could oppose those of a business or romantic partner today, Scorpio. One of you may be overly pragmatic and the other too idealistic. One seems callous, while the other seems to be living in a dream world. This could be a milestone in your relationship if approached properly. If you can't create a win/win situation, perhaps you should reconsider the partnership.",Scorpio
"Sep 22, 2022 - With the current celestial energy, you might be going on a trip, Scorpio. It may be for business, pleasure, or both. It's likely that this trip will achieve certain goals.

It's an excellent time for this, too.",Scorpio
"Sep 23, 2022 - Are you romantically attracted to someone you know through work, Scorpio? If so, this isn't a good time to pursue it. You might be wearing your heart on your sleeve a little too obviously. This could be unsettling for your friend, and it might sabotage the results you're hoping for. Be patient and let the relationship develop. Your feelings could well be mutual!",Scorpio
"Sep 24, 2022 - You could go over your accounts today and find that there's considerably less there than you thought. It isn't serious, but it can still be disappointing.

Think about it carefully and then follow your heart.",Scorpio
"Sep 27, 2022 - Instinct and determination drive you toward unconventional plans for making money, Scorpio. A finance counselor or other professional could be involved. You may see this as an opportunity to restore your ailing bank account. You may have future purchases in mind, perhaps even a new home. Consider your plans carefully before going ahead. You'll want to be sure it's what you need.",Scorpio
"Sep 28, 2022 - You may have lost your usual control of the purse strings and spent too much money lately, Scorpio. Don't worry about it. It's all been for a good cause. It's nothing you can't handle, and certainly not enough to bankrupt you. The situation is only temporary anyway. The financial picture looks great for you in the months to come. Make the most of it!",Scorpio
"Sep 29, 2022 - Today's planetary energies are stimulating your ambition, Scorpio. Issues connected with your professional life may be very much on your mind.

Once you start in a bran- new direction, there will be a great deal of support encouraging you to continue along that way.",Scorpio
"Oct 3, 2022 - Your reluctance to speak could get you in trouble today, Scorpio. You may hesitate to share what you know for fear of what others might think. You should realize that you're using this as an excuse to hide what's really just selfishness. Share your knowledge with others and you will be amazed at the knowledge that comes back to you in return. Keep in mind that you may need to wait for it.",Scorpio
"Oct 4, 2022 - Today your thoughts may turn to fashion and the different ways in which you can improve your wardrobe. Don't be afraid to create a look that reflects your true inner spirit.

"Oct 6, 2022 - When it comes to relationships with others, be careful about insisting that everything be done only your way, Scorpio. It could be that you have such high expectations of your partner that he or she will never be able to live up to your standards.

"Oct 8, 2022 - Be wary of big promises today, Scorpio. This could be one of those days when people are more likely to take a gamble because they're unrealistic about how things are going to work out.

"Oct 9, 2022 - You may feel more reserved than usual, Scorpio, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. You may be feeling apprehensive about expressing yourself fully, even in the most intimate situations. Be careful about sending messages that suggest that you don't want to be around others.

"Oct 10, 2022 - Changes may be taking place on the home front, Scorpio, perhaps unexpected repairs or someone moving in or out.

"Oct 11, 2022 - Today you might decide to tackle your financial paperwork and get it all done. This is a great day for that, Scorpio, although you might be a little too ambitious and not get as much done as you'd like.

Artistic ideas could flow freely, and you might think of different ways to put them to work for you.",Scorpio
"Oct 13, 2022 - You tend to be practical and businesslike by nature, Scorpio, but the tremendous growth you've experienced may increase your desire to be as sensible and efficient as possible in order to continue this trend.

You will like the results, though, so go for it.",Scorpio
"Oct 14, 2022 - There is some likelihood that you will be haunted by thoughts of your love life today, Scorpio.

"Oct 17, 2022 - Information coming your way today might be unreliable, Scorpio. It could be hard for you to take a solid hold on the messages you get. Keep in mind that there are important answers waiting to be heard. These answers will come to you when you least expect them. Keep your mind open to new possibilities and the path will open up and become clear. Don't compromise your consciousness with abusive substances.",Scorpio
"Oct 18, 2022 - You may end up being the peaceful savior that calms everyone down today, Scorpio. Use your artistic nature and love of beauty and harmony to inspire others to put away their differences and concentrate on the positive aspects.

"Oct 19, 2022 - If you've been reluctant to make a move, Scorpio, you should consider why. What has been holding you back? Fear of failure? A negative comment from someone else?

"Nov 2, 2022 - If a friend or acquaintance gives you advice about money or investments today, don't take it. To follow this unknowledgeable person's lead might prove to be disastrous.

Work on your own project.",Scorpio
"Nov 3, 2022 - What are you afraid of, Scorpio? Is it contact with other people? It's as if an invisible rope were holding you back from getting close to people, or worse, pulling you back. What's this about? You're going through a period that's closely linked to your past. A failed relationship still haunts you and casts its shadow on the current one. Get rid of the skeletons in your closet!",Scorpio
"Nov 4, 2022 - With today's celestial configuration, your emotional universe will once again glow with positive energy. You will be meeting more people, and your encounters are likely to be more profound. The coming weeks are quite promising for you, Scorpio. The music will be in the key to pleasure and sensuality.

"Nov 5, 2022 - Your innate talent and conscientious work ethic earn you admiration and respect. Whether you're aware of it or not, others look up to you as someone who has it together.

It's time to get to the source and exorcise the monsters for good! They have nothing to do with your success.",Scorpio
"Nov 6, 2022 - People may be difficult to deal with today, Scorpio. You may soon discover that they're just as stubborn as you are.

Don't consider it a loss or failure of character if you find you need to make some concessions in order to get things to work.",Scorpio
"Nov 7, 2022 - Minor tensions could arise today, Scorpio. People close to you, perhaps your mate or parents, seem to be trying to force you to adopt a behavior that you aren't at all willing to follow. Will you negotiate your independence gently or tear yourself free from their domination? The second possibility seems more likely.",Scorpio
"Nov 8, 2022 - There's some likelihood that a recent meeting with an influential person has put a damper on your hopes for your projects. Will you abandon them and live with regret?

This is the type of question you will have to resolve today, Scorpio.",Scorpio
"Nov 9, 2022 - Are you hankering for a little fun and longing for a little experimentation and perhaps even childish play? Tempting as these prospects are, you will have to ignore them. Scorpio, you simply don't have the time, at least not today. You will be too busy coping with numerous little emergencies that crop up and having to justify your decisions throughout the day.",Scorpio
"Nov 10, 2022 - Today you should think about your overdependence on money and material possessions, Scorpio.

"Nov 16, 2022 - If things haven't been going too well with those you spend most of your time with, Scorpio, it might be time to consider your expectations of them.

Consider talking with the people involved to find out how they feel.",Scorpio
"Nov 17, 2022 - The person who is most organized and stable will win the race, so let it be you, Scorpio. Be careful, though. Other people may try to distract you from your work.

"Nov 23, 2022 - Your mind is apt to be fixed on one thing today, Scorpio, and you won't rest until you've obtained it. Perhaps it's a physical place you're trying to get to, a new gadget that you want to own, or a person you'd like to get to know better. Don't be surprised if you have to put up a bit of a fight in order to accomplish this goal, whatever it may be.",Scorpio

Advice from others should steer you in the right direction.",Scorpio
"Nov 27, 2022 - You're obviously struggling with something big, Scorpio. Recent comments about your irritability are well founded. But don't worry. They'll forgive you eventually. In the meantime, do what you can to control your temper. It stems from your current fears, which seem to be multiplying exponentially. Blame the situation on the planets and accept it as a lesson on the path to self-realization.",Scorpio
"Nov 28, 2022 - Your mood may take a bizarre twist today, Scorpio, as you calm your desire to fight for something.

Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.",Scorpio
"Dec 1, 2022 - There might be some tension between you and your romantic partner that might have you feeling a bit depressed. The key to patching this up is honest communication.

By day's end, all should be well.",Scorpio
"Dec 2, 2022 - Feel free to strike out for new territory today, Scorpio, especially when it comes to love and romance.

Give people the love they need, and you will find that the love you require will come to you as well.",Scorpio
"Dec 5, 2022 - Make sure you leave things in better condition than you found them, Scorpio. This is a good time to tidy your personal space and the environment.

"Dec 6, 2022 - This kind of strange day doesn't come around often, Scorpio. It will seem as though you no longer know what you want. Do you have a yen to take off for the other side of the globe? People won't understand you, and you will think that explaining yourself is pointless. The best thing to do may be to unplug from your usual activities and go for a walk. You have nothing to lose.",Scorpio
"Dec 7, 2022 - There's some likelihood you'll become irritated with someone close to you today, Scorpio. Just who do they think they are, anyway? How insulting to put on such an act, especially considering how long you've known each other. Whatever you fight about, at the heart of it is your frustration and concern that your friendship may end. Try not to overreact. Express yourself mildly.",Scorpio
"Dec 8, 2022 - Something underhanded is going on, Scorpio. Unethical people could be trying to manipulate certain situations in order to turn them to their own benefit. Be careful! Steer clear of any ""political"" conversations, and refrain from commenting on any situation or listening to gossip. On the positive side, your intuition is sharp, so you should be able to sense the trustworthy.",Scorpio
"Dec 9, 2022 - If you've been thinking about a job change or even a new career, a chance interaction could provide the opportunity. However, Scorpio, remember, ""If something seems too good to be true, it probably is."" Get the facts as clearly as you can. Consider all the ins and outs before committing yourself or getting too excited about it. If you still want to pursue the opportunity, go for it.",Scorpio
"Dec 10, 2022 - Today your progress might slow a bit. Problems with computers, telephones, cell phones, or other forms of technology might interrupt your day, Scorpio.

You couldn't ask for a more productive day!",Scorpio
"Dec 17, 2022 - You need bigger and longer hugs than usual today, Scorpio. A powerful force is moving through your life and trying to shake things up.

Make sure you have a good hold on your emotions before you leave the house.",Scorpio
"Dec 18, 2022 - Today's planetary configuration has you wondering about an aspect of your life that causes you a good deal of hardship, Scorpio.

"Feb 4, 2022 - Today you may notice that you're feeling very creative and ambitious, Sagittarius. You might want to use these strengths to work directly on an artistic project.

Make the most of the day!",Saggitarius
"Feb 5, 2022 - Serious thinking and communication will be enhanced today, Sagittarius. These are strong qualities for you anyway, and with this added boost, you'll need to have a place to express yourself. If you’ve started a journal, this can prove to be an excellent outlet.

It's a perfect day to get things resolved.",Saggitarius

It might be far later than you'd hoped before you're able to see your friend. Better late than never!",Saggitarius
"Feb 11, 2022 - Working at home might be the answer for you today, Sagittarius. You could be physically and mentally worn out from working too hard, but you still have important tasks to complete. You may operate better on your own territory right now, without having to fight traffic or parking problems. You tend to be very conscientious where work is concerned, sometimes to your own detriment. Don't do this today; otherwise you might burn yourself out.",Saggitarius
"Feb 12, 2022 - Today is a good day to be receptive to other people's energies, Sagittarius. You’ll find that a sensitive attitude toward the people around you, combined with a bit of hard work and willingness to fulfill your responsibilities, will make for an unstoppable winning combination. Use this day to collect data and plan your goals. Take responsibility for your actions and don't be afraid to admit your mistakes.",Saggitarius
"Feb 13, 2022 - Bizarre news that comes to you from far away, possibly via email or the Internet, could be spreading like wildfire among the people you know and causing a lot of excitement, Sagittarius. Take care that you don't get too excited, since this is very likely to be misinformation that some rather weird minds have garbled. Consider it interesting, think about it, but don't take it seriously unless reliable sources confirm it.",Saggitarius
"Feb 14, 2022 - Your optimism and enthusiasm should be very high today, Sagittarius. Business and partnerships have been proving both satisfying and profitable lately, and you could receive information today about new doors that could unexpectedly open up for you. You've worked hard, supposedly without results, for a long time, and now it seems like everything's happening at once. This is very exciting, but remember that if you want to maintain your current pace, you have to keep working! Get going!",Saggitarius
"Feb 15, 2022 - The hard work and good business sense that you’ve put into your job may finally be paying off, Sagittarius. Expect some positive changes to take place at the workplace this week. Today you’re likely to be feeling especially energetic and decide to give your house a thorough cleaning. Don't try to do this on your own, however. You need to conserve your energy. Get other members of your household to help!",Saggitarius
"Feb 16, 2022 - An argument with your partner could have you feeling very disheartened and somewhat depressed today, Sagittarius. Yet you probably are too shaken up to feel like discussing it with him or her. Spend the day keeping yourself busy and working off your frustration. Forget about it for a while, Sagittarius. This should enable you to see the situation more objectively, so that you'll be in the proper frame of mind to kiss and make up when the evening comes.",Saggitarius
"Feb 17, 2022 - A minor conflict with a romantic partner in the morning is likely to end with a tearful reunion and much reassurance by mid-afternoon. The end of the day could find the two of you planning a romantic trip abroad, even down to the restaurants you want to try! Discussions of spiritual or psychic matters could also bring you closer together. All in all, it’s a tumultuous but romantic day.",Saggitarius
"Feb 18, 2022 - Children or possibly some close friends or a love interest could be upset today, Sagittarius. The financial coffers aren't full enough to afford something they think they absolutely have to have right now. You might find yourself having to soothe their feelings, reassuring them that ""not now"" doesn't necessarily mean ""never."" If they don't respond, don't keep pushing. They'll have to come to terms with the situation in their own way.",Saggitarius
"Feb 19, 2022 - The day may be temporarily plagued by scandal of some sort, Sagittarius. Some of your entourage, particularly women, may gather in conspiratorial gossip. Your curiosity will definitely be aroused, but don't be tempted to join them. There is more to the situation than meets the eye, and you'll want to know all the facts before jumping to conclusions. Concentrate on your own interests and worry about the scandal later!",Saggitarius
"Feb 20, 2022 - Some disappointing news could put you into a rather gloomy state at some point today, Sagittarius. Someone close to you might suddenly have to leave town for several weeks and you'll be lonely without them. There isn’t much point in dwelling on this, however. You'll just have to stay in touch via phone or email and look forward to the time when your friend comes back. You should be pretty busy during those days, anyway!",Saggitarius
"Feb 21, 2022 - Some interesting moneymaking opportunities are likely to come your way, Sagittarius, either today or in the near future. It could be that it’s time for a new job, one that promises faster progress through the ranks and more financial stability. Once you get past a certain age, working on commission loses its appeal. You’re ready for steady growth in your portfolio. Perhaps you should seek a financial planner for steps you could take right now to improve your bottom line.",Saggitarius
"Feb 22, 2022 - There are plenty of opportunities out there, and you’re tempted to seize every one of them. Well, Sagittarius, a bit of discrimination is in order if you’re going to make the best use of the auspicious atmosphere. Travel is definitely in the picture, as is continuing your education in some way. It could be something simple, such as enrolling in a cooking class at an adult education center. Or perhaps you're going to fulfill a lifelong ambition and apply to business school. Good for you!",Saggitarius
"Feb 23, 2022 - Something could happen during the day that unconsciously reminds you of something unpleasant that happened to you in the past, Sagittarius. You might not even remember today's event, but memories of the occurrence long ago could plague you throughout the day and put you in a very black mood. Try to analyze why this memory affects you so much. Then when you know, let it go. You might feel as if a heavy weight has been lifted off your shoulders.",Saggitarius
"Feb 24, 2022 - Your head is somewhat in the clouds today, Sagittarius. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it just means that it’s difficult for you to get any work done. Much as you'd rather be elsewhere, you really do need to stay focused on the projects at hand. By all means, plan an exit strategy from the mundane routine of your day-to-day life, but don't expect to make your escape today.",Saggitarius
"Feb 25, 2022 - This is bound to be a fascinating day, Sagittarius. You may have a foreign visitor who fills your mind with visions of adventures in faraway lands. Anyone you meet today is likely to be interesting, so be receptive to any new people who enter your life. Your curiosity and sense of adventure are piqued. You may decide to take a trip. If you do, be prepared for romance. It’s definitely in the stars for you.",Saggitarius
"Feb 26, 2022 - You may be feeling tired and a bit wrung out today, Sagittarius. Although you're a workaholic by nature, even you are forced to admit that this is a day to stay in bed. Give yourself these few hours to regroup and recoup your energy. You'll need to be operating at peak form for all the work that's likely to hit your desk next week.",Saggitarius
"Feb 27, 2022 - Today the energy is on partnerships, Sagittarius, probably those begun on the spur of the moment. You and a colleague might have a conversation about the possibility of going into business together. There is also the possibility that you could fall in love at first sight, maybe with someone from far away. Any sort of partnership formed today will have its ups and downs, but with work, it could succeed. If it feels right, go for it!",Saggitarius
"Feb 28, 2022 - If you overindulged last night, you're likely paying the price today. If your head is screaming and your blood feels like molasses, you know that too much of a good thing can make you feel rotten! Much as you feel driven to get out of bed and get on with your chores, there's no point, Sagittarius. You'd be better off resting. You'll be your old self by afternoon. Your work can wait until then.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"Mar 1, 2022 - Sudden events that come to you via TV, newspapers, or the Internet, could shake up long-cherished belief systems today, Sagittarius. This could have you feeling momentarily disconcerted and a bit disillusioned. At the same time, this information could open up new doors for you. Your natural curiosity will eventually win out, and you're likely to want to read all you can about whatever is on your mind. New discoveries can be fascinating!",Saggitarius
"Mar 2, 2022 - Your fantasy world will be especially active today, Sagittarius, and you should feel free to take off into dreamland. Let your imagination run the show today and you'll be delightfully surprised at the rewards this will bring to your everyday life. It may be hard to make a decision about anything practical, so don't even try. Leave it to a day in which you're feeling more grounded.",Saggitarius
"Mar 3, 2022 - Today you might experience a slight (and very temporary) dark night of the soul, Sagittarius. You could take a long look at your life and, even though you're doing well, still feel that you aren't yet where you want to be. Spiritually, you might doubt the traditional views you've questioned and still wonder about new concepts you've adopted. Try to distract yourself through reading or perhaps a movie. This feeling will pass by tomorrow.",Saggitarius
"Mar 4, 2022 - Unexpected communications from people far away could open up new opportunities regarding career, education, travel, or other broadening experiences. As a result, Sagittarius, new friendships could develop, as well as new ideas and possibly exciting new goals. Modern technology could play a major role in this development. A trip by air could be on the horizon, probably to a place you've never been before. Don't be too overwhelmed by it all!",Saggitarius
"Mar 5, 2022 - You might find yourself in a difficult situation when faced with a person who doesn't necessarily approve of how you're handling yourself, Sagittarius. It could be that someone misinterpreted one of your offhand remarks, and now is violently overreacting. Be careful of shooting back caustic remarks that could only aggravate the situation and elevate it to a damaging level. Your words will be taken more seriously than you think.",Saggitarius
"Mar 6, 2022 - Allow your eager and restless nature to express itself in ways other than through the spoken word, Sagittarius. Show someone that you care through your gentle touch or a big bear hug. Hold on a little bit more tightly than you might normally. There's an unspoken understanding that comes when you communicate through nothing but pure silence. Work on developing this kind of connection with those closest to you.",Saggitarius
"Mar 7, 2022 - Your mental processes may run into a snag as you discover that there are certain rules and guidelines by which you need to abide, Sagittarius. Sometimes you feel as if you're above all the rules, that you can establish your own based on your personal morals, and that everything will be fine. Unfortunately, you must sometimes obey others' rules. Try not to be upset by this; just deal with it.",Saggitarius
"Mar 8, 2022 - Your mind isn't likely to be on the job today. That could cause a number of problems. You might be feeling especially romantic. You're thinking about the evening when you can be alone with your romantic partner or at least luxuriate in racy novels or sexy movies. At lunch, buy some clothes you feel are especially flattering and then enjoy your evening!",Saggitarius
"Mar 9, 2022 - Plan your moves carefully today, Sagittarius, and have patience with the people around you. If you're working with others, be sure they're on the same page with your goals and aims and that they aren't somehow working counter to your purposes. It could be that someone is acting, or reacting, on misinformation that is creating conflict with your thoughts and feelings. Do a reality check before walking out the door.",Saggitarius
"Mar 10, 2022 - You might want to put on your suit of armor as soon as you wake up, Sagittarius. An all-out battle is raging out there, and it could seem like everyone has picked you as the main target. Be careful about escalating an issue even more by becoming defensive without first understanding the full scope of the matter. It could be that everything is coming to a head simply because of one slight misunderstanding.",Saggitarius
"Mar 11, 2022 - You may find yourself gravitating toward solid, grounded things, Sagittarius, in hopes that these will provide you with the stability that you lack. A key word for you today is patience. Learn how to wait without becoming restless or grumpy. What you will discover after a while is that the stability you seek is actually sitting right there inside of you, and has been all along.",Saggitarius
"Mar 12, 2022 - Issues regarding freedom are apt to come up today in more ways than one, Sagittarius. These issues could be connected with opportunities for adventure and travel. Although you initially want to dive into this promised freedom, take time to reflect on what you need in your current situation before making any final decision. Don't forget the other people in your life and how such actions might affect them and your relationships.",Saggitarius
"Mar 13, 2022 - Feel free to take full advantage of the very open social energies of today, Sagittarius. You, especially, will feel at home in any social gathering, totally at ease talking to new people and charming the room. This would be an ideal day to meet someone new. Someone of the opposite sex may be particularly attracted to you. Feel free to be as flirtatious as you want!",Saggitarius
"Mar 14, 2022 - Today's emotional energy risks being exceptionally high, Sagittarius. You may find yourself at the end of your rope by midday. Try to take a long walk or bike ride in order to calm down. Go by yourself and do some deep breathing outdoors. Try to avoid being drawn into other people's conflicts. Excuse yourself and trust that they can work things out on their own.",Saggitarius
"Mar 15, 2022 - Your heart is longing for a romantic encounter tonight, Sagittarius, and the partner in your life is more than willing to accommodate you. Nonetheless, circumstances beyond your control could interfere with your plans, and you might not be able to make contact tonight. This could bring frustration, dissatisfaction, and maybe even a little friction between you. Don't panic, though. It will pass, probably by tomorrow.",Saggitarius
"Mar 16, 2022 - Your energy level is high today, Sagittarius, but don't let this turn into a head-in-the-clouds attitude. Keep one foot firmly planted on the ground, because you may need to keep a level head in a work or personal situation. Keep in mind that the best way to deal with this is to use your positive energy to heal the difficult situation instead of letting this difficult situation get you down.",Saggitarius
"Mar 17, 2022 - If you've been thinking about trying some new investments or starting a new savings plan, this is the day to get started, Sagittarius. You're a lot more mentally focused than usual. People around you might have ideas that you should consider. You might experience some intuitive insights, so go with your gut. Don't let your mind get in the way. Tonight, keep a notebook by your bed to record your dreams!",Saggitarius
"Mar 18, 2022 - There is a great deal of unexpected communication coming your way today, Sagittarius, but be careful about the people you trust. There's an element of fantasy factored into the picture. This might cause some disruption if you automatically accept everything at face value. Make sure you check your sources at least twice before proceeding. You'll be much better off if you prepare for the worst.",Saggitarius
"Mar 19, 2022 - Overindulgence last night could have left you feeling a little woozy today, Sagittarius. You're may want to spend the day in bed, but the prospect of leaving tasks undone could cause you to push on anyway. That's a bad idea. Rest is just what you need. Don't force yourself to socialize, either. You need some time alone to recover and gather your resources so you can face the world with a clear head.",Saggitarius
"Mar 20, 2022 - A trip by air could be very much on your mind today. Perhaps you're planning a vacation with your family or a romantic partner. You could well be caught up in the excitement that seems to be the driving emotion today. Friends could offer advice, Sagittarius, but you aren't in the space to accept it, as your self-confidence is high. Expect to spend the evening in the congenial company of friends.",Saggitarius
"Mar 21, 2022 - Work may seem more like a drag than usual, as today your thoughts are at home with family, friends, and your partner in life, Sagittarius. You're unlikely to concentrate on work, and you might reach for the phone constantly to seek a friendly voice. Images of beautiful objects may dance in your head. Don't worry about your concentration. It will be back tomorrow!",Saggitarius
"Mar 22, 2022 - Memories welling up today could trigger a desire to get in touch with old friends, Sagittarius, or relatives you haven't seen in a long time. Some of these recollections could be bittersweet, bringing pain experienced in the past to the surface once more. Don't hang on to these ancient grievances. Work them out in your mind and then let them go. You might experience a deep-seated relief. You could even feel a little lightheaded.",Saggitarius
"Mar 23, 2022 - A business or romantic partner may seem a bit preoccupied with some very serious matters today, Sagittarius, and not be likely to share them with you. Asking to talk about it won't work, so you'll probably end up depending on your intuition. Your friend is probably concerned with the health of a family member who may need surgery. Don't feel excluded. Your friend will talk when the time is right. Be patient!",Saggitarius
"Mar 24, 2022 - Whatever work you do today could go more slowly than usual, Sagittarius, as you're apt to be a bit distracted. You may be preoccupied with the past, especially with feelings and events you thought you'd long forgotten that affect your mood in various ways. This might be a good day to concentrate on routine tasks that you can do automatically, if possible. That way you'll be as productive as always.",Saggitarius
"Mar 25, 2022 - You're apt to be especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of partners at this time, Sagittarius. In fact, you might find yourself picking up so much that it's a bit overwhelming. Nonetheless, it is an advantage. You'll probably know instinctively what those around you want, and this new sensitivity should definitely score you some points with business and romantic partners alike. Don't be afraid to make use of it. That's what it's there for.",Saggitarius
"Mar 26, 2022 - It doesn't seem fair that your workload has increased these last few days. Never mind that you still have all of your normal tasks to do, your boss expects you to finalize a new budget and write a proposal as well? Enlist the help of others if you can. If you can't, simply do the best you can without sacrificing time with your family and loved ones. Ultimately, Sagittarius, the latter is more important.",Saggitarius
"Mar 27, 2022 - A website or TV documentary could put you in touch with a promising educational or spiritual organization whose goals and aims seem to jibe perfectly with your own, Sagittarius. This could capture your interest and cause you to want to learn more. A friend may also want to explore this territory. Attend a class or workshop together and experience the programs directly. You may want to get actively involved.",Saggitarius
"Mar 28, 2022 - A keen ability on your part to blend the worlds of intellect and intuition could well surface today, Sagittarius. The ability to focus both these methods of perception into material reality is apt to give a boost to your career and educational efforts. It also could enhance your romantic life. Anything begun or completed today has an advantage. Try to look closely at this new tendency and make it last. It's definitely a plus!",Saggitarius
"Mar 29, 2022 - Incredible feelings of enthusiasm, optimism, and sheer joy could fill your heart and mind today, Sagittarius. Your life is changing in a positive way, and even though it may not be readily apparent, you're sensing it intuitively. Romance with someone from far away could be in the offing. If you're a writer, publishing is right around the corner. The only downside is that you might feel panicky, as if all this will disappear. Stay focused!",Saggitarius
"Mar 30, 2022 - Money worries could cause you to resist attending a group event with some friends, Sagittarius. Are you afraid you'll be tempted to spend more than you can afford now? You probably will, but that's no reason to stay away. Leave your checkbook and credit cards at home. Take only a minimal amount of cash. If you see something you can't live without, take the name and number of the vendor for later.",Saggitarius
"Mar 31, 2022 - Is your sweetheart out of town, Sagittarius? If so, you're probably feeling a bit lonely and insecure. You need to ignore those fantasies of your beloved out on the town having a great time with lots of glamorous people. Your friend is most likely as bored as you are, either transacting business or fulfilling family obligations. Relax, find something to do, and the time will pass before you know it.",Saggitarius
"Apr 1, 2022 - You could get the feeling that something is wrong today when it isn't, Sagittarius. It's probably just your perspective that needs some adjusting. Pull out your binoculars and focus a bit more so you can stand back yet have the power to examine the details closely. Don't automatically assume there's a clear distinction between right and wrong. There are likely a great many shades of gray, too.",Saggitarius
"Apr 2, 2022 - You could feel increasingly uncomfortable as the day goes on, Sagittarius. Perhaps you're tongue-tied in conversations - quite rare for you. The problem is that you simply don't know what to say, or if you do, you don't feel comfortable saying it in front of these people. Perhaps you feel you've lost your edge. Don't despair. This is only a passing phase. You should return to your full-blown communicative self before long.",Saggitarius
"Apr 3, 2022 - You might be pegged as the wise guy who's unable to take anything seriously, Sagittarius. Regardless of the situation, you can turn it into a joke of some sort. Your humor likely lifts the spirits of everyone around you. Be careful of taking this too far, however. There could be some people who are uncomfortable with your constant jesting. Let them know that you do have a serious side, too.",Saggitarius
"Apr 4, 2022 - Today can be a relaxing day, provided you make the necessary effort to deal with material constraints, Sagittarius. You would like nothing better than to spend much of the day planning fun activities for the future. But, alas, demands from your family, friends, or boss force you to concentrate on the here and now instead. Still, don't abandon your wonderfully pleasing ambitions altogether.",Saggitarius
"Apr 5, 2022 - It's possible that the last few weeks have allowed you to gain a little clarity on certain questions you may have about your vocation, Sagittarius. You might even be a little clearer about your feelings concerning what your destiny might be. The planetary energy makes this a good time to stop thinking about such questions and let your life take over. You are well prepared for this kind of thing!",Saggitarius
"Apr 6, 2022 - An unexpected visit from someone who lives far away is likely to throw your schedule off kilter, Sagittarius. Even though you'll be glad to see your friend, the visit could require a lot of calls to break appointments and postpone meetings. Once that's done, however, you'll have a good visit. You and your friend should each have a lot to report. You'll talk for hours. Relax and have some fun!",Saggitarius
"Apr 7, 2022 - An intense conversation with your romantic partner could take place today, Sagittarius. This could involve taking the relationship to the next commitment level, and the subject of marriage could come up. If you're already married, this could mean taking on a new responsibility, such as a house or child. If you aren't currently involved, expect to meet someone new and exciting who appeals to you on a number of levels.",Saggitarius
"Apr 8, 2022 - A moody family member could have you confused, Sagittarius, and you might not be able to discern the best way to find out what's bothering him or her. Don't overanalyze the situation. The best way is probably just to come right out and tactfully speak your mind. You'll probably find that this person simply has some minor problems to work through - nothing serious enough to worry about.",Saggitarius
"Apr 9, 2022 - A lack of physical and mental energy as well as motivation could have you in a lethargic mood today, Sagittarius. You won't feel like doing much of anything. You might get extremely irritated at the thought of having to work in any way. It might be a good idea to go to a movie in the evening, preferably a thriller or action movie. This will get your juices flowing again.",Saggitarius
"Apr 10, 2022 - Tending to paperwork could take up much of your time today, Sagittarius. A lot could be riding on your careful planning and projections, so you're probably taking it very seriously. Nonetheless, don't be intimidated. Trust your instincts. You know what you're doing. Be very thorough, check everything over carefully, then put your plan into action and wait for it to bear fruit!",Saggitarius
"Apr 11, 2022 - Have you been planning a trip by air, Sagittarius, perhaps to a distant place associated with a specific spiritual tradition? Warm places like Egypt, Mexico, or Israel could be especially appealing now. You could be going with a group of friends. If you haven't been considering such a journey, think about it. You might receive some surprising insights and revelations from such a trip. Start planning it now. Go for it!",Saggitarius
"Apr 12, 2022 - You need to pull yourself up by the bootstraps, Sagittarius. Why not take a few steps back and try to look at your life more objectively? Regardless of what you might be thinking at the moment, you do have a terrific life. Stop and count your blessings. Make a list and keep it in your wallet to refer to at low moments. Force yourself to be festive tonight. It will do you good to get out.",Saggitarius
"Apr 13, 2022 - The right moment to ask for a raise or apply for a promotion or new job could come your way today, but you'd better make use of it or the opportunity could pass you by. A chance for a romantic encounter or fun evening with friends could also come up. Whatever pleasant things arise today aren't sure things, Sagittarius, so don't let them escape. They could be significant milestones for you.",Saggitarius
"Apr 14, 2022 - If you've been thinking about making a career change, Sagittarius, today is a good day to do some research on professions that interest you. It may be that you're ready to take the leap and start a business of your own. Ideally, you'd have an able partner to help with the planning and execution. Get out your address book and college directory. It's likely that you already know the perfect person for the job.",Saggitarius
"Apr 15, 2022 - If you find yourself second-guessing plans you made earlier, Sagittarius, perhaps for a plane trip, try to look objectively at your concerns. You don't have to cancel everything if you have money worries. Your fears will probably turn out to be unfounded. This could be a good time to look into learning more about modern technology, either by enrolling in a class or attending a lecture. Evaluate vacation plans or a class with an analytical eye.",Saggitarius
"Apr 16, 2022 - Don't take any information you receive today at face value, Sagittarius. Technical glitches will likely plague you throughout the day. Your bank statement could be incomprehensible. Bills could show up with an extra zero tacked on. Don't panic. Make some phone calls and get all the facts. Whatever you do, don't let this ruin your day. Everything will get sorted out. Relax, put your feet up, and treat yourself to a cappuccino.",Saggitarius
"Apr 17, 2022 - Today should be devoted to paperwork and getting your financial affairs and budgets in order, Sagittarius. Once this is done, you can relax in the evening with friends and loved ones. You're especially intuitive right now, so you'll be able to pick up on all the unspoken thoughts and feelings of those around you.",Saggitarius
"Apr 18, 2022 - Guilt can be a powerful motivator, Sagittarius, but it isn't a pure one. Today you could feel obligated to help a family member with something you'd prefer to take no part in. There are times, like this, when familial duty trumps personal desires. Do your best to be helpful and gracious even though it could be a trying time for you. You'll feel good about yourself once it's all done.",Saggitarius
"Apr 19, 2022 - Whatever you're working on at this time can be expanded tremendously with the help of a partner, especially a creative project or written work, Sagittarius. Watch as one seed of an idea blossoms into a whole field of creativity. There is more than meets the eye as you find yourself soaring higher and higher. Remember that you're only restricted by your own imagination, so dream big.",Saggitarius
"Apr 20, 2022 - Messages from a distant state or foreign country, possibly through fax, email, or website, might not be totally accurate, Sagittarius. If any information presented in this fashion sets off an alarm bell in your head, be sure to do some research on your own and check out the facts. Don't accept any news at face value today. The lines of human and technical communication are definitely out of whack today.",Saggitarius
"Apr 21, 2022 - Are you going on a trip or possibly moving, Sagittarius? Is education involved in some way? Whatever your reasons for going away, you're going to gain whatever you hope for - and more. Writing, teaching, and anything involving communication should go very well right now, including conversations with a romantic partner. Your mind is quick and retentive right now, so make the most of it.",Saggitarius
"Apr 22, 2022 - Today you could encounter a work colleague and suddenly feel an unexpected romantic attraction, Sagittarius. This could catch you off guard because you never before thought about this person in that way. Before jumping in with both feet, give yourself some time to come down. You're feeling especially sensual today, so this might well pass by tomorrow. Stay grounded for now. If the attraction is still there in a few days, think about it!",Saggitarius
"Apr 23, 2022 - Don't take anything you hear today at face value, Sagittarius, especially where money is concerned. A well-meaning friend could approach you with an opportunity not to be missed. Listen to the pitch and take down all the information, but don't make any kind of commitment. You'll likely see several flaws when you review the information later. Point them out to your friend. You'll save this person money and embarrassment by speaking up.",Saggitarius
"Apr 24, 2022 - You could have a “eureka!” moment today, Sagittarius, as events from your past unexpectedly bubble to the surface of your mind and crystallize in a surprising new way. Suddenly, you have a clear understanding of how these past events affect your present behavior. You can use this new knowledge to bring about change. There is clearly a situation at work or at home that is in need of transformation.",Saggitarius
"Apr 25, 2022 - You probably know that you don't attain freedom in one fell swoop, but rather bit by bit as you go through life, Sagittarius. Perhaps you've been feeling as if you don't have enough freedom. Over the next few days you could find the situations or people you need in order to liberate yourself. Don't forget that love is the greatest freedom of all. It could be time to make room for it in your life.",Saggitarius
"Apr 26, 2022 - You have certainly felt better than you do today, Sagittarius. We'll pause here while you go and fetch the aspirin. The stomachache and headache are simply the result of recent overindulgence. Don't worry - you'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow morning. Next time someone offers you multiple helpings of food or drink, however, you might want to consider politely declining!",Saggitarius
"Apr 27, 2022 - Today you might feel a little out of sorts, Sagittarius, and your concentration could be diminished. You might even have a little trouble focusing on your work. Don't worry about it. It's more mental than anything else, and it will pass. You might feel the need to drink coffee all day to stay alert. Try to exercise some restraint on this, since it could be counterproductive. Hang in there.",Saggitarius
"Apr 28, 2022 - Friendships and romantic bonds should provide a rich source of support and good companionship today, Sagittarius. Conversation is likely to be light, covering general matters like current events and the weather, but this might be just what you need right now. Someone could introduce you to some new friends from far away who have some intriguing news of their own. This should prove a light, restful, and altogether very pleasant day. Enjoy!",Saggitarius
"Apr 29, 2022 - A neighbor or relative might volunteer to help you with some chores around the house, Sagittarius, but you could sense that his or her heart isn't in it. This person is probably thinking about things and just needs some kind words and a little advice. Just accept that even though you have help, you'll probably end up doing most of the work yourself. Offer what support you can, and think of it as good karma.",Saggitarius
"Apr 30, 2022 - Some of your demons may come back to haunt you today, Sagittarius. You could find yourself battling some of those same old doubts and insecurities that you thought you'd left behind. Your desire for a higher standard of living will have you preoccupied with money concerns in the middle of the day. These concerns will pass, so take a deep breath and try not to worry too much.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"May 1, 2022 - Yes, Sagittarius, your projects have taken some time to get set up. This is because you haven't been concentrating hard enough. You are doing several things at once, with the result that things have been moving more slowly than you expected. Your change in orientation requires you to focus your energy in a single direction. However, the question remains - what direction?",Saggitarius
"May 2, 2022 - You're apt to speak and act with a great deal of power, Sagittarius, but be careful that you don't get swept away by emotion. There's a surrealistic quality to the day. It could lead you to believe a mirage is real. You might get so caught up in the drama of your feelings that your power of reason gets watered down to the point where you lose track of your objectivity altogether.",Saggitarius
"May 3, 2022 - Just for today, Sagittarius, ignore your habit of always trying to find an explanation for everything. Something is changing inside you and in the way you react to situations. The desire to incorporate life's more unpredictable aspects into your personality is the basis for these changes. A lot of your theories are only there to reassure you, but you probably know that. Why not try being honest with yourself?",Saggitarius
"May 4, 2022 - Old memories, traumas, and phobias from the past could affect your mood today, Sagittarius. You might feel depressed without really knowing why. An event in your life has brought these feelings near the surface without revealing the source. If you've had any disturbing dreams or visions lately, write them down. They might offer a clue as to what's bothering you. Meditation or free association could also bring the release you need.",Saggitarius
"May 5, 2022 - Uncertainty about professional matters can lead to an increased determination to get ahead, Sagittarius, despite confusion as to how to do it exactly. It might be wise to do some research, organize all your information, and use that to formulate a plan of action. The resulting advancement may be slow moving, but it's sure and steady. A wealth of experience that enriches your life should follow.",Saggitarius
"May 6, 2022 - Your physical vitality should be quite strong, Sagittarius, and you're encouraged by greater self-confidence. At the same time, however, someone seems to be trying to ruffle your feathers by being selfish and disrespectful of your space. This is likely to lead to conflict that you don't need. The good news is that it's likely to open you up to a different perspective, one that can ultimately be useful in understanding the situation.",Saggitarius
"May 7, 2022 - Things are coming to a difficult stalemate regarding the love in your life, Sagittarius. Perhaps you've felt like everything was going fine and you had nothing to worry about. In reality, this notion of ""fine"" was just your self-denial hard at work making you think that you could continue on your path without really considering how your actions affected others. Be prepared for a reality check that you didn't see coming.",Saggitarius
"May 8, 2022 - This is a good moment to adapt your logic and reason to reality, Sagittarius. If you don't, you're going to run into some intellectual problems. Everyone knows that you find new ideas plentiful, but unless you have plans to be a novelist, link your thinking to reality. The ""pie in the sky"" thinking that you engage in isn't particularly useful to the rest of us living here in the real world.",Saggitarius
"May 9, 2022 - The mood is one of bustle and change, Sagittarius. It's a good day to clear out your wardrobe or other belongings. Out with the old, in with the new! You may consign the old stuff to the basement or give it to charity. The main thing is to make room for your new tastes and new relationships. A new person is being born in you. Clear the path for this being to come through!",Saggitarius
"May 10, 2022 - Although the forecast is stormy, the day ahead may give you an opportunity to free yourself from your family, literally or figuratively. Be wary even if the course seems clear to you. You could be in danger of being swayed by a powerful person. The resolutions you make today could have a major impact on your future.",Saggitarius
"May 11, 2022 - If you've been feeling deep anger, today isn't the day to let it out but rather the day to consider its source. Any large gatherings of family or friends should be avoided at all costs. No, this doesn't mean you get to take the day off! Just be extra careful about your temper. A little isolation will go a long way toward easing your tension, and may give you some important insights.",Saggitarius
"May 12, 2022 - New investment possibilities could present themselves to you today, Sagittarius. This could involve an investment of time, money, or other resources. You might also consider an exciting new start of some sort. Don't let yourself get so excited that you move ahead before you consider all the pros and cons. You might want to consult a friend or your partner. This would make an excellent excuse to schedule a romantic evening!",Saggitarius
"May 13, 2022 - A new phase in your life is beginning, Sagittarius. The previous phase could be interpreted as having taught you to be serious and devoted to professional responsibilities. And you did accomplish some good deeds to boot. Now you can relax and look ahead to what's next. Let yourself feel the welcome tug of the future.",Saggitarius
"May 14, 2022 - The only good thing about being on an emotional roller coaster is that you never feel the same way for long, Sagittarius. One moment you're up, the next you're down. You can't figure out what it is you want today. Rather than bring your loved ones along on this wild ride, why not take some time away from your usual environment? You'll be a lot better off alone. Who knows? Something important may come out of these moments of solitude!",Saggitarius
"May 15, 2022 - It's possible that the last few weeks have allowed you to become a little bit clearer concerning certain questions you have about your vocation, Sagittarius. You may even have a little more clarity about your feelings regarding what you think your destiny is. It would now be better for you to stop thinking about such things and let life take over. You're well armed for this!",Saggitarius
"May 16, 2022 - You might feel like your emotions are up in the air, Sagittarius. As soon as you feel emotional, there may be a more structured force telling you to be reasonable. Both camps are valid, so try not to let one overpower the other. Don't completely disregard your emotions in favor of a more cerebral way of handling a situation. And don't let your emotions take control of your actions either. Balance is the watchword today.",Saggitarius
"May 17, 2022 - Dare to express your ideas without fear of ridicule. This is what the planetary configuration has to say to you today, Sagittarius. And this is exactly what you need to hear, because fear of ridicule is generally your Achilles heel. The challenge for you is to clearly say what you think without referring to or borrowing the ideas of others. Dare to do it!",Saggitarius
"May 18, 2022 - Seduction through words is your real power, Sagittarius. You have a great talent for anything involving words. So you're going to be able to attract even more admirers around you today! With the current planetary energy at work, you'll surely get first prize in any contest of words. If you've been thinking about writing a love letter or a profile for a dating website, by all means, do so now!",Saggitarius
"May 19, 2022 - Discipline and a sense of duty have been major themes for you lately, Sagittarius. It might seem like someone has put the brakes on a current plan of yours. Try not to see this as negative. In reality, this is an important time for you to slow down and plan. Be aware of the passage of time and consider using this period to organize your scattered energy. This is a good time to focus and streamline your life.",Saggitarius
"May 20, 2022 - Your lighthearted social demeanor could find a hard time fitting in with the general mood of the crowd today, Sagittarius. You might find that you're better off simply locating a quiet place and retreating from the group for a little while. Read a good book or magazine. Plan for the days ahead and let your mind prepare for the things you have in store.",Saggitarius
"May 21, 2022 - The current configuration of the planets will make you the bearer of a new philosophy, Sagittarius. This doesn't mean that you'll be New Age, but more precisely that you'll have ideas that evolved from it. It's easy to imagine you attending conferences given by the leading minds of the day. Most assuredly, you're searching for answers. Be careful about being too easily convinced by any ""truth"" that comes your way.",Saggitarius
"May 22, 2022 - If situations get too hot and heavy, Sagittarius, your first instinct is to run away or jump to the next subject before anyone notices you're avoiding the serious ones. That's one way to deal with today's intensity, but deep down you know it isn't the best. What you really need to do is dig deep and take advantage of this emotional energy to thoroughly take care of things instead of skim over them.",Saggitarius
"May 23, 2022 - Your heart is going pitty-pat, Sagittarius, and you're tempted to escape to a romantic fantasyland in which you play the starring role. The bad news is that something could be trying to hold you back. It could be that responsibility is coming on the scene and reminding you that work needs to be done here in the real world before you can go off to your little fairytale world.",Saggitarius
"May 24, 2022 - “Evidence” is the word for today, Sagittarius. Everyone knows that you have a facility for spending your time thinking and analyzing. Today, on the other hand, you're going to be ""seeing” things. They will be clear. It will no longer be necessary to study, ponder, and review from every angle. It's a little like you've just invented a new theory that repeatedly gets confirmed by others throughout the day.",Saggitarius
"May 25, 2022 - You might find that your brain is chugging along in the slow lane today, Sagittarius. It could even be gradually creeping over to the breakdown lane! It may be more difficult to come up with your quick, witty rebuttals in conversations. Take your time and make sure you choose your words very carefully. Communicating with others might be a bit like pulling teeth today.",Saggitarius
"May 26, 2022 - Issues involving fashion, magazines, and the spoken or written word will all slowly begin to take a turn in a positive direction today, Sagittarius. You may find that these things have been somewhat obscured lately, or at least their development has been more backward than forward. The good news is that the tide is turning. You should notice over the next few weeks that things are getting back on track.",Saggitarius
"May 27, 2022 - The key for you today is to use your heart more than your head, Sagittarius. Base your actions on your feelings and your inner knowing of the situation. Facts may deceive you. It could be that you've come to rely so much on a linear, logical way of thinking that you can't see any other way. It's important that you see the interconnectedness of many of the different areas in your life.",Saggitarius
"May 28, 2022 - It may be that you've returned deeply changed from a long voyage, Sagittarius. Of course, we're all changed to some extent by travel, but in your case, the change is truly profound. You're going to have some problems getting back into the life you had before you left. Your old life is likely to feel too limiting to you. So what are you waiting for? Change it!",Saggitarius
"May 29, 2022 - Take off to the stars today, Sagittarius, and keep your mind and heart open to all that's possible when you have faith in yourself and the work you do. Mastery of a skill comes when you have the guts to always take it to the next level. Consider different areas of your life that require more of that confidence at this time. Balance courage with common sense as you implement this attitude in as many ways as possible.",Saggitarius
"May 30, 2022 - Like playing a game of chess, think carefully about your next move, Sagittarius. Maybe your opponent is taking a long time to make their next move. If you let impatience force your hand, you could make your decision too hastily. Feel free to take as much time as you need. The other person may already be thinking two or three moves ahead of you. Staying calm and focused will help you concentrate.",Saggitarius
"May 31, 2022 - Today you have the ability to make an important breakthrough in something you've been working on, Sagittarius. Try not to get bogged down by emotions, which may leave you feeling heavy and stale. Infuse the day with a blast of unconventional thinking. Adopt a fresh attitude toward whatever it is you want to accomplish. A new perspective is all you need to make this day productive.",Saggitarius
"Jun 1, 2022 - Creative inspiration could come from deep within today, Sagittarius. Visions, dreams - anything that excites your imagination - could bring ideas for new projects. You might also find that your understanding of others greatly increases, attracting new and old friends. The only downside is you could get so lost in ideas that you temporarily lose touch with the material world. Try to keep a foot in both camps.",Saggitarius
"Jun 2, 2022 - Your mind could be focused on exalted spiritual concepts today, Sagittarius. You might decide to try to study spiritual or metaphysical materials, or attend a virtual lecture, workshop, or meditation session with people who share this interest. You might also think about traveling to a country associated with a specific spiritual tradition, such as Israel, Egypt, or India at some point in the future. Write down your insights so you can refer to them later.",Saggitarius
"Jun 3, 2022 - Although you should be feeling especially close to friends, lovers, and family, Sagittarius, you might find it hard to communicate with them today. Perhaps they have troubles they prefer to keep private and you're confused, wondering if they're upset with you. Chances are they aren't. However, they probably need to work things out for themselves. Be patient. Try to understand. They may share their problems with you tomorrow.",Saggitarius
"Jun 4, 2022 - You may be looking forward to talking on the phone with someone dear who lives far away, Sagittarius, but circumstances beyond your control could get in the way. Perhaps you keep missing each other, or problems with computers or phones throw a monkey wrench into the works. Don't let this dim your enthusiasm. Once you reach your friend, expect to have an exciting and emotionally gratifying conversation.",Saggitarius
"Jun 5, 2022 - Sagittarius, today you might hear of opportunities coming from an unusual source and consider taking advantage of them. Values take a more spiritual turn as your material goals are reached. You might make plans to participate more in activities like yoga, meditation or other activities with a metaphysical focus, and you're looking forward to it. Someone close to you might recommend some interesting books.",Saggitarius
"Jun 6, 2022 - Sagittarius, some interesting insights could steer you in the right direction regarding a goal you've been working toward for a long time. You generally prefer logic to ESP, but today your intuition is so strong that it's difficult to resist. You could also feel a burst of physical energy that spurs you on to do whatever needs to be done. Don't worry about what's rational. Follow your heart.",Saggitarius
"Jun 7, 2022 - Today you might find that your social life takes a definite turn for the better. You could receive more than one text or call that piques your interest, Sagittarius, and you’ll spend a lot of time discussing arrangements for future get-togethers. If you aren't romantically involved now, you may find out about someone promising. If you're involved, make sure you reserve time for an intimate encounter with your special someone, if possible. Have fun.",Saggitarius
"Jun 8, 2022 - People around you might have been expecting a bit more cooperation on your part. You could be nicer and more concerned about their needs. It seems that you've been ill-tempered recently. You like acting this way occasionally. Sometimes you act like a child who wants to play more. If you indulge this urge to play more often, you'll be able to be more loving toward your entourage.",Saggitarius
"Jun 9, 2022 - Are you an intellectual or a poet, a novelist or a playwright, Sagittarius? The celestial energy leaves you alone with your anxieties and questions. You are sure of only one thing - words are the friends you've decided to spend the rest of your life with. This is a kind of dream and challenge that corresponds with your Sagittarius identity. Get to work. You'll find your vocation and passion in your writing.",Saggitarius
"Jun 10, 2022 - You're a very active person, Sagittarius, but today you'll probably be disappointed. If you ask those around you to help with your activities, they most likely won't understand your needs. They'll wonder why you need to move constantly and why you need to create. The day may seem exhausting and complicated to you.",Saggitarius
"Jun 11, 2022 - You generally like to think of yourself as someone who faces life logically and rationally, Sagittarius, but today your intuitive side could prove a valuable resource, especially when it comes to dealing with others. Your communicative ability is enhanced by a strong sense of what others are thinking and feeling. This opens the door to more effective communication with everyone - friends, lovers, colleagues, even strangers.",Saggitarius
"Jun 12, 2022 - A lost possession could be recovered today. A gift, either money or a long-desired item of some kind, could bring tears to your eyes, Sagittarius. Your sense of self-worth should be high at his time and could cause you to feel nurturing towards everyone around you who doesn't have your self-confidence. New opportunities for increasing your income could come your way. Make the most of them.",Saggitarius
"Jun 13, 2022 - You will wake up today on cloud nine, Sagittarius. Your morale is at a peak. You will feel totally free and be able to clearly perceive the essentials of life. You have the perfect opportunity to share this gift from the stars with your loved ones. Even after this aspect has passed, you may have trouble getting your feet back on the ground. Don't rush it.",Saggitarius
"Jun 14, 2022 - Today you're about to put your sense of humor to the test, Sagittarius. You'll likely confront a few unexpected situations. Even if you're used to finding exciting things to do in an ordinary world, you'll be in for a big surprise or two. Today there will be a lot of excitement where you least expect it. Try to let the day's energy guide you.",Saggitarius
"Jun 15, 2022 - Others, particularly family members, might be rather quiet today. It could seem as if everyone is running around like crazy but not sharing what's on their minds. You'll have to trust your intuition when you need to know what they're up to, Sagittarius. Writing could come from deep within, whether through letters, poetry, or novels, allowing you to express a facet you don't often see. Use this spiritual gift and dig deeper.",Saggitarius
"Jun 16, 2022 - Today you're apt to be a bit preoccupied, Sagittarius. You might find yourself considering concepts that others think are strange and impractical. This might involve metaphysics or the occult or unusual ways of making a living - or all of the above. You might want to discuss this with others. However, you should make a decision based on your preferences without influence from those who aren't directly involved.",Saggitarius
"Jun 17, 2022 - Some people around you might think that you have never really matured, Sagittarius, that you still have the mind of a child. It might not seem obvious at first, but your lighthearted attitude is also a sign of great wisdom. As with those who have truly committed to long-term romances, you will find out that you'll never lose your lightheartedness.",Saggitarius
"Jun 18, 2022 - You have a generous nature, Sagittarius. You know how to give and devote yourself to solving the problems others that confide in you. This will still be true today, but not entirely in the same way. In fact, it wouldn't be wise for people to bother you with their problems if they really aren't all that important. It's high time for you to take care of yourself for a while.",Saggitarius
"Jun 19, 2022 - Sagittarius, the atmosphere of the day gives you the impression that there could be a lot of changes waiting to unfold in your personal life. Most of them will concern your relationships. Today you could feel as if you've just changed your star sign. Take the time to open up and listen to what the stars might reveal to you. This will be time well spent.",Saggitarius
"Jun 20, 2022 - Research on a subject related to a project could have you heading to a place where you can read without being constantly distracted, Sagittarius. Your concentration is high and you're likely to accomplish a lot in this regard. Although you might not find the material as interesting as you'd hoped, the quality of the work you produce is going to get the attention of people in authority. Get going.",Saggitarius
"Jun 21, 2022 - There is a fun-loving, boisterous energy to the day that should give you a great deal of power and self-confidence. You'll be extremely effective in everything you put your hand to, Sagittarius. Remember to love yourself and believe in the things you say and do. Generate passionate love from your heart. No one will be able to respond with anything but the same.",Saggitarius
"Jun 22, 2022 - Take it easy today, Sagittarius, and work to digest some of the input you've received over the past couple days. This is a day to contemplate and plan. With matters of the heart, you may find that a sensitive, grounded approach works best. This isn't always your favorite mode of operation, but it's one that will provide you with the balance to counteract your usual frenzied pace.",Saggitarius
"Jun 23, 2022 - Go for the gold, Sagittarius. Today marks the beginning of the rest of your life. Treat it with respect. You may be on a crusade and your combative instincts could be working overtime. There's a lot of fuel in your engine, so don't worry about running out. The only thing you really need to be concerned about is possibly stepping on other people's toes. Make sure you consider how your actions affect others.",Saggitarius
"Jun 24, 2022 - Recent spiritual breakthroughs might have you feeling both exhilarated and downcast. Your sensitive side tells you that this is a definite step forward on your spiritual path, but your logical side might cause you to doubt the reality of it. Take comfort in the fact that reality is relative, Sagittarius. What you're sensing is at least valid for you. Then keep moving ahead.",Saggitarius
"Jun 25, 2022 - Trying to get too much work done in the course of one day might prove self-defeating today, Sagittarius. Your energy isn't what it usually is, and you're probably operating on nervous energy. Consider the situation and list your tasks in order of urgency. The world won't come to an end if you don't get them all done today. In the evening, rent a pile of DVDs, order a pizza, and relax.",Saggitarius
"Jun 26, 2022 - Uptight is the word for today, Sagittarius. At some point you might find yourself the center of attention. While you normally might not mind, now it could make you a bit nervous. When you find everyone looking at you and expecting you to say something, say it, keep it short, and then withdraw. You aren't in the mood. Visit your favorite online sites and read about subjects that interest you to relieve the stress.",Saggitarius
"Jun 27, 2022 - You may feel some indecision regarding a loved one today, Sagittarius. Something could be urging you to act in this department, yet you might find that you just want to lay low. Realize that there's an important next step that you must take. Think the situation through before you make a move. In fact, this day is best spent gathering data. Perhaps you should wait before doing something about it.",Saggitarius
"Jun 28, 2022 - An increased understanding of distant cultures as well as curiosity about the people who live there could spur you on to further learning about those places, Sagittarius. Friends or groups with which you're affiliated could be involved in some way. You're likely to channel a lot of energy into intellectual activities today and inspire others to do the same. Take a walk at some point during the day to clear your head.",Saggitarius
"Jun 29, 2022 - Today is a good day for you to simply get things done. Take care of those annoying tasks that have been building up for a while. You have a great opportunity to accomplish quite a bit. People are less concerned with frivolous drivel and gossip than they are with setting a plan for meeting an important goal. Contribute to this trend by getting serious about the tasks at hand.",Saggitarius
"Jun 30, 2022 - As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you might find that you're leaving behind some fundamental principles and values along the way, Sagittarius. Don't lose sight of your foundation. Things could get shaken up today. Your ego might be on trial for pig-headed behavior. Keep yourself in check and be aware of the way you project yourself to others.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"Jul 1, 2022 - You might find that there's a quality of dreaminess to your emotions today that keeps you from focusing on the task at hand, Sagittarius. People are likely to be stubborn and confused, and you could be one of them. It might seem as if your mind is going in two directions and you aren't sure which way to proceed. Try to incorporate more of your dreams into your waking reality.",Saggitarius
"Jul 2, 2022 - Your physical stamina is apt to be quite strong today, Sagittarius. You should consider working out to release some of that pent-up energy. Engage in a sport or something that involves strategy and good coordination. Pick up a tennis racquet or join a basketball game, if possible. You'll find that your high level of energy will be the key to coming out on top.",Saggitarius
"Jul 3, 2022 - Get up and get going today, Sagittarius. You have no time to lose. Your quick mind will be busy working on many tasks, but this suits you just fine. You're well equipped to deal with the many frantic situations that are apt to crop up. There is a great deal of strength to your emotions that you can use to connect with others and communicate your thoughts in a healthy manner.",Saggitarius
"Jul 4, 2022 - You may say one thing one minute and the opposite the next, Sagittarius. Usually you can jump from one issue to another with no problem, but today people are likely going to call you on it. Think about what you really mean before you say it. Don't do all your thinking aloud where other people can hear. Your continuous thought process might be mistaken for a final analysis. Confusion could ensue.",Saggitarius
"Jul 5, 2022 - Your mind may seem rather cloudy today, Sagittarius, but don't let this hinder you. In fact, you'll find that you can use this feeling of fantasy to your advantage. Try to bring more magic into your life. You'll discover that the more you accept your bizarre feelings and ideas, the more things will fall into place. Don't think that everything in life has to be completely rational.",Saggitarius
"Jul 6, 2022 - Listen closely to the wind, for the answers are blowing around right in front of you today, Sagittarius. Contact people you haven't heard from in a while. You'll find that you can be quite productive where you least expect it. Ironically, the less you plan, the more you'll get done. Be spontaneous in your actions. Revelations will come to you like lightning.",Saggitarius
"Jul 7, 2022 - This is an important day for you to make valuable connections with others, Sagittarius. You'll find yourself engaged in fast-paced, witty conversations and debates from which you can learn a great deal. You're good at seeing both sides of an issue, but the problem is that this can lead to indecisiveness and an inability to commit to anything. Choose a path today and stick to it.",Saggitarius
"Jul 8, 2022 - People may be a bit critical of you today, Sagittarius, and you would do well to hear what they have to say. Be receptive of feedback from others so that you may establish a healthy ego. It's important to keep your sense of humility in check. You might find that you're feeling rather critical as you see people moving like sloths compared to your lightning quick mind. Be patient with others.",Saggitarius
"Jul 9, 2022 - The doldrums are over and its time to pick up the pace, Sagittarius. Come out of your home in full regalia today and be proud of what you have to offer to the world. Be courageous in your dealings with others and take the time to express yourself fully in a creative manner. The bigger the smile you wear, the further you'll go in just about every situation you encounter.",Saggitarius
"Jul 10, 2022 - You might find yourself daydreaming about faraway places, Sagittarius, perhaps toying with the idea of taking a long vacation by air to a place you've always wanted to visit in the future. This isn't a good day to make definite plans. You aren't likely to be inclined to do that now anyway. Love matters may take an unexpected turn, as a spiritual bond seems to be forming between you and a potential romantic partner.",Saggitarius
"Jul 11, 2022 - Be careful not to be too cavalier today, Sagittarius. It would be wise to adopt a more serious tone than you normally would. You might be inclined to be careless with your words, but people are going to take you very literally. Make sure you say things that you actually mean. Your attention to fashion and pop culture may conflict with a force that's asking you to focus on things of deeper spiritual value.",Saggitarius
"Jul 12, 2022 - You may have the spark that wants to light things today, Sagittarius. Indeed, there's a fast-paced tendency to the day that is right up your ally. You should be able to accomplish quite a bit under the prevailing trends. Just make sure you're constructive with criticism and be careful that you aren't too abrasive toward the people you deal with. In other words, be nice.",Saggitarius
"Jul 13, 2022 - A friend could put you in touch with a lot of interesting people, some in fields such as law, education, or the ministry. Expect at some point to be treated to a monologue on social and ecological responsibilities, Sagittarius! You'll have a lot of definite ideas on those subjects, but you'll be more likely to listen than talk for most of the day. Enjoy your day.",Saggitarius
"Jul 14, 2022 - Romantic feelings blossom today, Sagittarius. You may suddenly appear more attractive than usual. Lovers and potential lovers may seem unusually attentive. You could also be feeling very creative, and you might want to try your hand at poetry or fiction. Reading romantic novels or seeing romantic movies could also be appealing. Surround yourself with candles, flowers, and music, and enjoy!",Saggitarius
"Jul 15, 2022 - Friction with family members, particularly women, could prove irritating, especially since you're torn between their quirks and the love you have for them. This isn't the time to hold grudges, Sagittarius. Let them go. You might feel the urge to do some home repairs, redecorate, or otherwise improve your home, or perhaps cook a great meal. Channel your energy into these activities instead of quarreling. You'll be glad you did.",Saggitarius
"Jul 16, 2022 - Do countries abroad represent real opportunities for you, Sagittarius? This is a question that you'll soon have to answer. The grass may be greener on the other side of the world, but have you considered the possibility that it isn't? Could it be that the dream of working abroad is a convenient explanation for the dissatisfaction you feel at work? It's important to solve this riddle, because you'll soon make some key decisions that depend on the answer.",Saggitarius
"Jul 17, 2022 - Letters, phone calls, or emails from afar could put you in touch with new, interesting people. These people could well bring some fascinating ideas your way, Sagittarius. Shared knowledge can lead to mutual advancement on material and spiritual levels. This process just might turn a casual acquaintance into a firm friend. Expect a lot of contact with these people for a long time to come. Enjoy your day.",Saggitarius
"Jul 18, 2022 - You could feel restless and anxious to get out in the open for a while today, Sagittarius, but mundane tasks could force you to postpone it. Someone you care about might ask for a favor, and while you may not want to help this person, you probably will. Don't let your irritation show - just get it done quickly and accept the person's thanks. In the evening, go for a long walk under the stars.",Saggitarius
"Jul 19, 2022 - Situations regarding love and romance are likely to get much heavier and more intense now, Sagittarius. Are you ready to make a deeper commitment to the one you love? It may be quite hard for you to make a solid commitment because you could be wary of the freedom you'll lose. Now is the time to face the music and really dedicate yourself to the people who mean the most to you.",Saggitarius
"Jul 20, 2022 - Today it might suddenly hit you that you have a lot of unfinished tasks that need to be completed, and this might lead to a case of the blues. Take heart! The process appears more overwhelming than it is, Sagittarius. A little planning and focused discipline should enable you to get through everything without stressing yourself out too much. In the evening, reward yourself with a meal out or a movie.",Saggitarius
"Jul 21, 2022 - Your relationships are going well from an intellectual perspective, Sagittarius, but from an emotional one, you might feel like they aren't as fulfilling as you'd like. Perhaps you're letting your brain do too much of the driving. It's time to let your heart take over and have its needs be tended to for a while. As your energy shifts, so will that of people around you. Let them react however they will. Try not to be upset by the changes that follow.",Saggitarius
"Jul 22, 2022 - Take inventory of your habits and behaviors, Sagittarius. Look to certain patterns and note the ones that do and don't work for you. You'll more than likely feel an urge to break free from repetition and create new paths that allow for other opportunities to come along. You may not even be consciously aware that in many ways you're beating a dead horse. Don't continue to waste your energy on paths that go nowhere.",Saggitarius
"Jul 23, 2022 - Today isn't a great day for inspiring enthusiasm in others, Sagittarius. You might find that there's a sober, conservative tone to the day that's stealing the fuel from your fire. Realize that this is just part of the natural cycle of things. Don't feel that you need to be up and active all the time. Give yourself a rest and focus your energy inward. Settle your nerves and get down to business.",Saggitarius
"Jul 24, 2022 - Don't second-guess yourself today, Sagittarius. It could be that you're wavering so much about a decision that even after you make it, you hesitate to follow through with it. Once you make up your mind about something, stick with it. Have confidence in your own mental process. Once you begin to waver, it may be difficult to find the assurance that you need since you'll inevitably slide down the slippery slope of self-doubt.",Saggitarius
"Jul 25, 2022 - Today is a terrific day to express your thoughts, Sagittarius. You'll find your mind especially clear and ready to tackle any mental issue that comes your way. Your tendency is toward free and unconventional ways of problem solving. Express the importance of being able to think for yourself. Write letters, make calls, and surprise someone with a personal visit. Connect with friends you haven't spoken with in a long time.",Saggitarius
"Jul 26, 2022 - Consider going on a trip with a close loved one, Sagittarius. A long-term break from the current reality may be just the thing needed to infuse a new blast of romance into your life. If you're unattached, you might find that going on an adventure to a foreign country results in meeting the love of your life. Broaden your horizons and look to new ways of thinking and believing.",Saggitarius
"Jul 27, 2022 - Tune into your dreams today, Sagittarius. Do you often feel intensely jealous thinking the people around you are living amazing lives while you're stuck in a dull, boring routine? The only person who can pull you out of this rut is you, so stop complaining and do it. Change is easier than it seems at first. Let your imagination take control and work toward manifesting your most fanciful goals.",Saggitarius
"Jul 28, 2022 - Your receptivity to new ideas is stronger than usual today, Sagittarius. Listen to what people say and remember that you can learn from every person you meet. There's a lesson in every situation. Remember to keep your brain exercised, just like any other part of your body. To keep it working properly, you must make sure you give it the daily stimulus that it requires.",Saggitarius
"Jul 29, 2022 - It's a long road to becoming exactly the person you want to be, Sagittarius. You can't change who you are. Input from every person you know and lessons from every bump in the road contribute to who you are as a person. Be proud of yourself, but also realize that there's a great deal more internal development that needs to be done. Meditate or be alone for a little while.",Saggitarius
"Jul 30, 2022 - You have a keen analytical mind that has served you well in business. Alas, Sagittarius, this characteristic doesn't always serve you well in your personal life. It's likely that someone close has bristled from your lack of empathy. Take time to reflect upon the events of the past few weeks. Did you inadvertently send a wrong message? Correct any unintentional slights. A simple ""I'm sorry,"" will do wonders.",Saggitarius
"Jul 31, 2022 - Finally, Sagittarius, you'll be able to breathe a long overdue sigh of relief. It's likely that you've been worried about your finances for some time. Well, you need worry no longer. The events of today either put you back in the black or show you a clear path to get there. You've been working hard to resolve these financial matters. You can now start working smarter.",Saggitarius
"Aug 1, 2022 - Be a bit more sensitive with your words today, Sagittarius. Your mind is apt to be especially active and even a bit restless. This is more than likely a signal to get more of your opinions out into the world. As you do, make sure you consider the feelings of others. People might have quite a different reaction to the same situation. Respect opposing viewpoints.",Saggitarius
"Aug 2, 2022 - Be a bit more selective in terms of where you put your energy today, Sagittarius. Don't waste your time with situations that aren't healthy or conducive to your aims. You may find it hard to get motivated, but this is fine. This is a good day to lay low. Your energy is apt to feel rather sluggish, so be conservative with how you use it. Pace yourself throughout the day.",Saggitarius
"Aug 3, 2022 - You're riding a wave of prosperity and things are looking up for you, Sagittarius. The situation today may appear too good to be true. The bad news is that's probably the case. It may be that the truth is being masked, and that there's a great deal of speculation and hype causing a frenzy of activity. Feel free to join the frivolity but realize that the bubble may burst tomorrow.",Saggitarius
"Aug 4, 2022 - This isn't a good day to travel, Sagittarius, especially by air. Long lines at the ticket counter, endless delays, and lost luggage could be the result. This may not even be a good day to plan a trip, although you can consider your options. If you must fly today, get to the airport early, travel light, and take something good to read. That will make it bearable.",Saggitarius
"Aug 5, 2022 - You may feel a need to add some fantasy to your daily routine today, Sagittarius. Do you have someone in mind you'd like Cupid's arrow to strike? Well, don't rely on a cherub to do your work for you. Get out and do some target practice of your own so you'll be prepared when you see the object of your desire across a crowded room. Keep things light and cheerful.",Saggitarius
"Aug 6, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you leap out of bed with a spark of inspiration that wasn't there last night, Sagittarius. Let your dreams linger a bit before you face the world. This flash of genius is likely to strike quickly and unexpectedly, so keep an eye out for it, but don't consider it something that you can plan on or force into happening.",Saggitarius
"Aug 7, 2022 - An unexpected chance to fly to a faraway place, perhaps at someone else's expense, could come to you today, Sagittarius. A group might be involved, perhaps one connected with education. Do you lecture or teach? If so, this might be a chance to give a lecture in an exciting place you've never been to before. Get your materials together, pack your bag, and go. Have fun!",Saggitarius
"Aug 8, 2022 - You're probably feeling especially energetic but with little if any outlet for your energy, Sagittarius. Increased irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, yoga, or aerobics. These can produce endorphins that override the stress. Go for it.",Saggitarius
"Aug 9, 2022 - Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, Sagittarius. This could involve a romantic relationship. Jealousy is often groundless, so avoid it by doing some communicating. This is the time to make the effort to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Strong emotions can work for you under some circumstances. A passionate reconciliation is better than an angry estrangement.",Saggitarius
"Aug 10, 2022 - Expect some great news regarding money, possibly professional advancement. You may have to control the urge to break into tears of joy, Sagittarius. A female friend could be going through some heavy changes and might want your support. Your best course of action would be to listen rather than offer advice. You may have to try hard to control yourself, however. The situation could defy all reason.",Saggitarius
"Aug 11, 2022 - Some fascinating new information, possibly spiritual or metaphysical, could come today from periodicals, TV, or the Internet. This could set you on a new course of study, Sagittarius. Your insights and revelations could prove valuable in increasing your understanding of what you read. This evening, expect a surprising message from someone you haven't heard from in a while. Enjoy!",Saggitarius
"Aug 12, 2022 - If possible, a social event could take place today involving a small number of friends you may not have seen for a long time, Sagittarius. You'll feel good about catching up and meeting exciting new people, too. Interesting information could come your way. Someone might be upset about something and want a shoulder to cry on. But this should be mostly a happy and gratifying day for you. Enjoy.",Saggitarius
"Aug 13, 2022 - This is a great day to start new enterprises with others, Sagittarius. Possible gatherings with friends or group activities could lead to ideas for new projects that fire your energy and enthusiasm. New immediate and long-term goals should be set. Some people may not be interested and could drop out, but don't worry. Others who share your interests will quickly step in to take their places.",Saggitarius
"Aug 14, 2022 - You could feel as if the battle has begun and you're the target, Sagittarius. If you don't have a solid force behind you, this period could be difficult. Emotionally, this may not be your best day. Instead of feeling your feelings, you examine them in a methodical, rational manner. It may seem like you're dealing with them when you're really trying to talk yourself out of feeling them at all.",Saggitarius
"Aug 15, 2022 - Make some plans for recreation, Sagittarius. Having something fun to look forward to can make even the toughest times far easier to handle. You'll be amazed at how much you can manage when there's an end in sight. Your whole attitude lightens, so take the bull by the horns and create your own incentives. Do something special to reward yourself for the hard work you do every day.",Saggitarius
"Aug 16, 2022 - Today you may feel very creative and ambitious, Sagittarius. You might want to use this energy to work on an artistic project, or you may choose to channel it into such activities as organizing your home or workspace. If you plan for it, there should be plenty of time to do both if you have a mind to. Make the most of the day.",Saggitarius
"Aug 17, 2022 - Serious thinking and communication are enhanced today, Sagittarius. They're already strong qualities in you, and with this added boost, you'll need an outlet for expression. A journal is an excellent vehicle. Talking is another. If you have issues or worries, consider getting together with all involved and airing your thoughts. It's a perfect day to resolve problems.",Saggitarius
"Aug 18, 2022 - Today, Sagittarius, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially strong if you've solved a problem. You may find that others often try to change your decisions, but not today. Things are working in your favor and you'll feel new strength as a result. Follow your heart.",Saggitarius
"Aug 19, 2022 - Use your creativity to make things happen today, Sagittarius. This doesn't have to take the form of a finished product. You can come up with new and innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust your ability to discover such things. You're known for your sharp thinking and creative abilities. Combining them can make you unstoppable when finding solutions to almost any problem.",Saggitarius
"Aug 20, 2022 - Don't worry about being productive today, Sagittarius. You might still accomplish more than you have in a long time. The cosmic energy indicates that if you didn't get everything done that you wanted to yesterday, you're sure to do it today. Dig in your heels and go. Things will get done with time to spare. If you're into a creative hobby, work on that, too. You'll find it rewarding.",Saggitarius
"Aug 21, 2022 - You'll find that your spark can easily turn potential energy into kinetic energy, Sagittarius. Don't underestimate the power of your words. Realize the profound impact they have on others and take responsibility for their consequences. Try to use them sparingly if you can. Speak half as much as you normally would, but make each sentence resonate twice as powerfully.",Saggitarius
"Aug 22, 2022 - Emotionally, you may feel as if you're running up against a brick wall, Sagittarius. It could be that your first reaction is to drown your sorrows in drink. Escapism is only a temporary remedy. If things slam in your face today, use this as an indication that you need to take necessary action. Don't keep bouncing around from one thing to the next in order to avoid the obvious. Face the music.",Saggitarius
"Aug 23, 2022 - Don't be surprised if your inbox fills with email or your phone rings off the hook, Sagittarius. Friends, relatives, and colleagues could have great news and useful information. One or more of these messages could inspire you to send a few of your own or even pay some visits. Most of what you learn should be positive and exciting, although some things may be confusing.",Saggitarius
"Aug 24, 2022 - A powerful desire for a current or potential romantic partner might come over you today, Sagittarius. This person could live far away or be on a trip, so you might have to be satisfied with a phone call or email instead of the meeting you'd prefer. Don't get frustrated. Distract yourself with an exciting novel or movie and look forward to when you can get together.",Saggitarius
"Aug 25, 2022 - Use the day's boisterous energy to take charge and make things happen, Sagittarius. You'll find that actions you take today resonate in the coming days. Don't worry about the consequences. Simply go for the gusto. Strong forces are at work encouraging you to seek freedom in your creative endeavors and giving you more room to explore your inner sanctuary that you hold so dearly.",Saggitarius
"Aug 26, 2022 - This is a wonderful day for you, Sagittarius. You'll find that you're holding all the cards you need to be successful. Today luck and prosperity meet with discipline to create a perfect situation for wealth. Your preparation is finally paying off. You'll find that the more in tune you can be with yourself, the better integrated you'll be with the people around you.",Saggitarius
"Aug 27, 2022 - Friendship could turn into romance if you aren't careful, Sagittarius. A platonic relationship could turn passionate, and no one would be more surprised than you. Think carefully about where you'd like this to go. While it can't go back to the way it was, you can stop it from progressing further if you're uncomfortable with the new dynamic. You can only make this decision once.",Saggitarius
"Aug 28, 2022 - Any work today could require a higher level of concentration than you can muster, Sagittarius. You might lapse into daydreams, think about personal matters, and feel guilty because you aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing. On days like this it's best to focus on routine tasks you can do automatically. That way, your mind can wander. That's the only way you'll make it through today.",Saggitarius
"Aug 29, 2022 - You're feeling pretty strong now, Sagittarius. You're probably in fairly good health and your mind is sharp. You've outgrown some areas of your life that no longer seem what they once were. One of these could be your work. You could be considering leaving a job you took primarily for the money and going into a profession you really love. Do it if it works for you.",Saggitarius
"Aug 30, 2022 - You may be focused on a certain trajectory, Sagittarius, but today you could run into complications based on overlooked issues. Be aware of the people around you and how your actions affect them. You don't necessarily need to change your direction, but you might need to make a couple modifications along the way in order to keep everyone happy.",Saggitarius
"Aug 31, 2022 - It isn't exactly all lightness and harmony at home today, Sagittarius. There's tension in the air and it manifests in silly family arguments. Try to arrange separate activities for siblings, and encourage your partner to eat out with friends, if possible. This is a day to give everyone his or her space. Tomorrow everyone will be happy to eat together again.",Saggitarius
"Sep 1, 2022 - People may see you as the personification of drama, especially this morning, Sagittarius. This is a good time to express your emotions and get things out of your system. Be sure to release whatever pent-up emotion you have inside. By afternoon, it might be a good idea to settle down and lay low. Turn your energy inward, come to your center, and plan what needs to get done.",Saggitarius
"Sep 2, 2022 - Money is probably on your mind now, Sagittarius. A desire for increased financial security could force you to look for work or investments that would pay off big. Opportunities for one or both of these are likely to come through friends, perhaps someone with whom you've worked before. You're likely to accomplish what you want for now, but it's uncertain whether you'll continue on this path in the future.",Saggitarius
"Sep 3, 2022 - A trip by air may be in your future, Sagittarius. You may be planning to tour distant states or foreign lands when that’s possible. You could be going with friends or a group you're associated with. Unusual new interests could capture your attention, enticing you to further study. You might enroll in an online workshop. You're looking toward expanding your horizons. Take care not to spread yourself too thin.",Saggitarius
"Sep 4, 2022 - Your mood may be a bit detached and scattered today, Sagittarius. This attitude could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. Make sure you keep at least one foot on the ground. It's important to stay strongly connected with reality or you could find yourself up a creek without a paddle. Feel free to get more deeply involved in a project that you might otherwise leave to others.",Saggitarius
"Sep 5, 2022 - You could be in a fanciful mood all day, Sagittarius, so you may not be too focused on this world. This is great for artistic or metaphysical studies, as well as being sensitive to others. Beware of a tendency to daydream when you should pay attention! You might want to break out of the mundane world and follow your dreams, but this isn't the day to do it. It's a good day to plan.",Saggitarius
"Sep 6, 2022 - Some new information could come your way that causes you to focus on a new interest, Sagittarius. It'll set your mind traveling to faraway places and times. You may also communicate with some new people who are highly educated, from foreign lands, or both. They might have fascinating stories to tell! Whatever happens, today promises to excite your curiosity and stimulate your intellect.",Saggitarius
"Sep 7, 2022 - Weariness may have you feeling a bit listless today, Sagittarius, and you're likely to want to stay home in bed rather than go anywhere. This goes against your normal inclination, so you could be tempted to bite the bullet and get out in spite of your malaise. Don't fall into this trap. Get some rest so that when you absolutely have to go out, you'll be your old self again.",Saggitarius
"Sep 8, 2022 - Issues regarding love and romance are at a climactic point right now, Sagittarius, and you could be rather combative. Your energy in this area may come in waves, and you're likely to be so charged up about the situation that you feel like a time bomb ready to explode. Don't destroy something wonderful by wanting a great deal more than you really need.",Saggitarius
"Sep 9, 2022 - You've probably had a busy week, Sagittarius, and may feel out of sorts today. Perhaps you had too much good food last night, stayed up too late, or both. It goes against your grain to stay in and rest, but this is the perfect day to curl up with a good book. You're going to want some exercise, but don't overdo it. As you well know, you can get too much of a good thing!",Saggitarius
"Sep 10, 2022 - Your world is changing, Sagittarius, both internally and externally. You feel a need to broaden your horizons. You may be contemplating a move to a new neighborhood or trip to a faraway land. The people in your life will change as a result of this. You're about to embark on a new phase of life, and these new friends will act as able guides.",Saggitarius
"Sep 11, 2022 - Online group activities that you attend today are likely to be spiritually oriented, such as group meditations. You could communicate with new friends from faraway places who share your interests. Though you're usually more intellectually inclined, today you should be feeling especially intuitive. Write down your thoughts and ideas lest you forget them. You may want to use them later.",Saggitarius
"Sep 12, 2022 - Stress and job frustration might have you thinking about breaking free, walking out the door, and going somewhere else. Another thought is likely to concern going back to school and training for a career in another field. You might need a vacation, and returning to school could be a great idea in the future, but don't decide today. Wait a few days at least.",Saggitarius
"Sep 13, 2022 - You could encounter a potential romantic partner today, Sagittarius. You'll probably communicate with this person at a virtual group event and hit it off immediately. This person is likely to be bright, physically attractive, kindhearted, and sensitive. If you're single and available, don't pass up this opportunity. Take advantage of the chance to get to know each other. Who knows where this might lead?",Saggitarius
"Sep 14, 2022 - Your fantasy world is piqued today, Sagittarius. Your imagination is running wild. Maintain a certain amount of control over your emotions or they may get the better of you. You could find yourself in a cloud of confusion by afternoon. Avoid this by trying to ground yourself throughout the day. Make sure your actions result from an equal balance between thought and emotion.",Saggitarius
"Sep 15, 2022 - Does it feel like someone's raining on your parade today, Sagittarius? No surprise there. You may feel like you're stuck in a bog, so wear your galoshes and give it your best shot. That's all you can do. People may be extra touchy and impatient with ridiculous banter, even if it is polite. Try not to make sense of things that seem confusing now. Come back to them in a couple days.",Saggitarius
"Sep 16, 2022 - A meeting - virtual or otherwise - is likely to happen during the course of the working day, Sagittarius. This should lead to pleasant and interesting conversations, possibly involving philosophy, spiritual matters, or the arts. Communication should be clear and open. Correspondence could take up almost as much time as conversations right now.",Saggitarius
"Sep 17, 2022 - You might find yourself reeling from shock when an old friend suddenly seems to show romantic interest in you. Conflicting emotions could come up, but don't write it off if you're available. There could be potential for a good relationship with this person. Don't feel that you have to either jump right in or forget the whole thing. You can test the waters for a while!",Saggitarius
"Sep 18, 2022 - Are you presently negotiating a contract, Sagittarius? If you and the other party disagree on any points, these differences will most likely be resolved. You'll probably come up with an idea that creates a win/win situation so both of you feel good about it. This will strengthen your relationship considerably, so expect partnership matters to progress smoothly. Enjoy your day.",Saggitarius
"Sep 19, 2022 - Initiate a major change in your life, Sagittarius. Break free of the humdrum and launch into something exciting. Take part in an online class that expands your mind. Consider yoga, tarot, or any form of martial arts. You have a tremendous amount of energy today. It will help you maintain confidence and endurance as you do the groundwork to put this new life-enhancing endeavor in motion.",Saggitarius
"Sep 20, 2022 - A passionate encounter with a love partner might cement the bond between you so thoroughly that you start talking about commitment or even a wedding. A romantic haze may permeate your interactions. Still, exercise some restraint in expressing your feelings. Hitting your friend with too much at once could have the opposite effect from the one you're hoping for. Be patient!",Saggitarius
"Sep 21, 2022 - If you've been having trouble reaching a romantic partner, Sagittarius, it might be a good idea to stop trying. Your friend is having a rough day and might not make the best company. In fact, your beloved could view a call from you as an unwelcome interruption and be short, if not downright rude. If you speak with your friend, keep it brief and plan to get together - just not today.",Saggitarius
"Sep 22, 2022 - Don't be surprised if money comes from an unlikely source. It could be a surprisingly good return on an investment or a bequest from a relative. Pay attention to any dreams that seem to repeat. They may hold a lesson about understanding your life path. You may receive an unexpected visit from a dear friend you haven't heard from in years. All in all, this is a great time.",Saggitarius
"Sep 23, 2022 - Inspiration for writing, music, drawing, painting, or other creative activities could hover just out of reach today, Sagittarius. Great ideas could pop into your head and out just as quickly. The only way to avoid the frustration of missing out on wonderful ideas is to write them down as soon as they come. Making notes can also stimulate further inspiration. Go for it!",Saggitarius
"Sep 24, 2022 - Have you been going crazy with all the demands placed on you? Don't despair. Reflect on all that's been going on. Think about where you want to make changes. Once you've come to a decision, don't hesitate to implement it. This is easier than waiting for one big opportunity and doing it all at once. That chance may never come. The step-by-step approach can bring satisfying results.",Saggitarius
"Sep 25, 2022 - You may be ready for some major career changes, Sagittarius. You could be fed up with the stress and long hours of the corporate environment. Surely in this age of technology there's a way to spend more time at home without sacrificing the quality of your work. Think about it for a few days. If you propose a feasible alternative to your boss, the positive response may surprise you.",Saggitarius
"Sep 26, 2022 - An unexpected opportunity to go on a long journey, perhaps business-related, could come to you soon, Sagittarius. A partner might be involved. Your enthusiasm may be almost boundless but remember that your physical energy isn't. If you choose to travel right now, make sure you take necessary precautions. Otherwise, have fun!",Saggitarius
"Sep 27, 2022 - Today you may feel a passionate attraction for someone intelligent who perhaps makes a living in law, education, or publishing, Sagittarius. Conversations with this person could touch on some deep issues, such as spiritual matters, the human psyche, or the nature of the universe. You should be deeply affected, not only by the person but also by the subjects. Take a walk later to clear your head.",Saggitarius
"Sep 28, 2022 - Generally, you're a very sociable person, Sagittarius, and today you won’t want to slow down. Invitations to parties, from intimate coffee klatches to big neighborhood bashes, continue to come in, but you weigh the pros and cons of attending carefully now. Saying no goes against your nature because you don't want to miss anything. But right now, you must pick the most important to you and leave the rest.",Saggitarius
"Sep 29, 2022 - You've been so busy these past few weeks that you may have inadvertently neglected the special person in your life, Sagittarius. It's been fun to be out and about together, but that has left little time for closeness and snuggling. Try to rectify that today. In fact, a midafternoon nap might be called for. Why not invite your honey to join you?",Saggitarius
"Sep 30, 2022 - Don't be surprised to see your co-workers acting a bit silly today, Sagittarius. There is no getting around the high spirits that permeate the work environment. It's almost impossible to get anything done with today's planetary atmosphere. Rather than cracking the whip and trying to increase productivity, why not join in? Lighten up a little.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"Oct 1, 2022 - Are you involved in a creative project that involves modern technology, Sagittarius? If so, progress could be made by leaps and bounds, starting today. A lucky break might set you off in a new direction that adds depth and dimension to your work. Communication with colleagues should be warm, congenial, and supportive. There is a sense of unity that pervades the group and adds to the energy and enthusiasm. You will love the results of your efforts.",Saggitarius
"Oct 2, 2022 - One quick phone call to a friend may turn into a long discussion about the meaning of life, Sagittarius. Be conscious of the fact that there's a great deal of momentum building in your mind now. Once the dam breaks, you may soon have a giant flood on your hands. Be careful about releasing all this energy at once, even though you may not seem to have a choice.",Saggitarius
"Oct 3, 2022 - There may be a great tension between you and someone older today, Sagittarius. Perhaps there's someone who's adopting a sort of ""parent knows best"" personality that's starting to annoy you. Take a breather. Realize that this person isn't being critical or judgmental but just giving you advice. You should open your eyes and understand that this advice could be very useful.",Saggitarius
"Oct 4, 2022 - The amazing thing about your nature is that, like a good politician, you have just the right tone of voice and catch phrase for every situation. You can put on your smile and charm and talk your way out of just about any pickle you get into. Embrace this incredible gift, but make sure that your overall goals are noble as opposed to self-serving or vengeful.",Saggitarius
"Oct 5, 2022 - A co-worker might be away, and this could increase the amount of work that you have to do, causing strain and upset, especially if you aren't familiar with the work. Don't try to do it all at once. A distant family member you haven't heard from for a while could phone out of the blue, and you could spend a happy half hour catching up.",Saggitarius
"Oct 6, 2022 - Your fantasies could come true now, especially when it comes to relationships, Sagittarius. This could be the moment you've always dreamed about, so get ready. The attractive, romantic person in the corner has been keeping an eye on you all night. Your blood is pumping faster than ever. Remind yourself that all dreams can come true on a day such as today.",Saggitarius
"Oct 7, 2022 - Consider taking a more conservative approach to your actions today, Sagittarius, as well as to the way you dress. Others may be rather put off by something that comes across as too flashy. Fashion is apt to be a significant concern for you now, which is fine. Don't underestimate the power of personal appearance.",Saggitarius
"Oct 8, 2022 - Feel free to go shopping online for yourself, Sagittarius. While you're at it, you might as well pick out some things for others, too. You're apt to be in tune with the pleasant spirit of the people around you. On the other hand, if they're being especially negative or cranky, don't hesitate to just go elsewhere. Unfortunately, that may be easier said than done.",Saggitarius
"Oct 9, 2022 - Be careful about being too boisterous and chipper around people who don't exactly feel the same way, Sagittarius. Be sensitive to other people's feelings, and don't make jokes that are too harsh for the occasion. No one appreciates a wise guy. There's a somber mood to the day that's likely to form a dark cloud by late afternoon. Do your best to be the ray of sunshine and not the bolt of lightning.",Saggitarius
"Oct 10, 2022 - An unexpected and perhaps not altogether welcome call could come your way today, Sagittarius. It could come from someone you don't particularly care for or someone who has some disconcerting news to report. Whichever it is, you will probably just have to deal with it. However, you may feel about the caller or what he or she has to report, you will probably consider it important to have the conversation.",Saggitarius
"Oct 11, 2022 - Your mind is usually quick, agile, and hungry for information, Sagittarius. Today it's likely to be even more so than usual. Your curiosity is high, and you could go to unusual lengths to satisfy it. You might also feel particularly energetic and want to get in a good workout. This is a good idea. Exercise can clear your head and give you a better perspective on new ideas and information.",Saggitarius
"Oct 12, 2022 - Someone you care about but haven't seen for a long time could suddenly contact you. You'd usually love this, Sagittarius, but today you could be too caught up in projects of your own to want to put them aside. But you will have a lot of fun with this person, and you might even interest him or her in your project. After finishing your work, get some delicious takeout.",Saggitarius
"Oct 13, 2022 - You probably think of yourself as a curious intellectual, Sagittarius, but a recent expansion in career and finance has brought out talents for business and money that you didn't know you had. This has been a time not only of success and good fortune but also of learning more about yourself. Don't fall back on old fears or underestimate yourself. You're capable of accomplishing more than you know.",Saggitarius
"Oct 14, 2022 - Today, more than ever, you will yearn to escape the daily routine, Sagittarius. You thirst for new sights and sounds, new faces and new places, but you know you must juggle your desires with professional and domestic obligations. It isn't always easy. Trust your imagination to find a way to settle this conflict.",Saggitarius
"Oct 15, 2022 - Good news about money could create some excitement in your household today, Sagittarius. One of your goals might be to invest some of the funds in fixing up your living situation. You might even consider moving or purchasing a new home. You may kick around a lot of ideas about how to spend the windfall, but don't go too crazy. Hold on to some of that money as a nest egg.",Saggitarius
"Oct 16, 2022 - This is a terrific day for you, Sagittarius, and you will find that the fast pace of the day suits you well for what you need to get done. There's a general feeling of grandeur in the air that reminds you to take your time when getting dressed. Feel free to go all out today. Put on a lavish display wherever you go.",Saggitarius
"Oct 17, 2022 - Be careful about being manipulated by another person today, Sagittarius. It's possible that someone is putting words in your mouth in order to get you to act a certain way. Don't fall into this trap. Be your own person and think for yourself. Your mind is susceptible and vulnerable now. Use your eyes and ears as a filter and don't let people unload their garbage on you.",Saggitarius
"Oct 18, 2022 - Your unique ability to communicate with many different groups and personalities will be extremely important today to maintaining a bridge between warring camps, Sagittarius. Keep things moving and try not to let the situation stagnate on any one issue. If the conversation turns to raging and ranting, it's in your best interests to stop it right away. Don't be afraid to step up and take a leadership role.",Saggitarius
"Oct 19, 2022 - Discipline and a solid plan are your friends today, Sagittarius. Slow your approach and consider the consequences of your actions. This is the time to concentrate on what you need to get done and devise a plan to make it happen. There is restlessness in the air that might cause you to act hastily. Don't forget the old saying that says haste makes waste. This is an important lesson.",Saggitarius
"Oct 20, 2022 - By being around negative and flip people, you might inadvertently pick up these habits. Be careful about your associates, Sagittarius, because you will find that others judge you according to the company you keep, especially if you start talking like them. Make sure to maintain a respectful attitude and proper manners no matter who your company is.",Saggitarius
"Oct 21, 2022 - This is a terrific day for you, Sagittarius, and you will glow brightly from head to toe as you radiate your true inner self to the world. You will find profound joy in the simplest, most ordinary circumstances. If you run out of things to say, feel free to whistle a tune. This isn't likely to happen today, since you will overflow with things to talk about.",Saggitarius
"Oct 22, 2022 - Although your financial situation appears to be on the upswing, you still might be feeling pessimistic and indifferent about money and life in general. You might want to soothe your discontent by overspending, overindulging in food or drink, or both. Don't let this feeling get the better of you, Sagittarius. Get together with some friends, if possible, and have a good time. Treat yourself to a little something without going over the top!",Saggitarius
"Oct 23, 2022 - A career goal you've been hoping to reach may seem uncertain now, Sagittarius. You could be wondering if your work has gone for naught. Don't think this way. There's a lot going on behind the scenes that you aren't aware of yet. When you hear about these developments, you will know that you're still in the running. Don't waste your whole day thinking about work. Try to relax. Tomorrow it may all come together.",Saggitarius
"Oct 24, 2022 - A sudden and unexpected opportunity to take a journey by air could come your way today, Sagittarius. This might be something you've wanted for a long time finally manifesting. Certainly, adventure is in the air, although it might be mental adventure as much as physical. Some information could come your way that catapults you into a new and exciting field of interest. This promises to be a thoroughly stimulating day.",Saggitarius
"Oct 25, 2022 - If you've been planning a long trip by air, Sagittarius, today you might doubt whether you should continue with your plans. Money or safety might be the issues. Be aware that your fears may run away with you. The situation may be more secure than it appears. You might want to attend an online class or lecture, perhaps on computer science or some other technology. As with the vacation plans, try to view this objectively.",Saggitarius
"Oct 26, 2022 - Upsetting news that you receive from far away, perhaps by phone or email, could send you into an emotional tailspin. There's an aura of uncertainty about what you hear - it may not make sense. Before you pass along the news or panic, Sagittarius, make sure you know all the facts. You're likely to find that it's been blown all out of proportion. In view of this, you deserve a fun evening.",Saggitarius
"Oct 27, 2022 - Past impressions that you may not even know you have could enhance your ability to deal with practical matters today, Sagittarius. You might need to handle some paperwork regarding a settlement of some kind. The thoughts and feelings of those closest to you are more apparent than usual. You may tailor your behavior toward them accordingly. Spend a quiet evening with your loved ones. You won't even need to talk.",Saggitarius
"Oct 28, 2022 - Emotions stemming from past experiences might cause you to assume undue responsibilities, particularly concerning family members. This is fine as long as you realize what you're doing is as much for you as for the other person. Whatever tasks you assume may allow you to release old traumas and give form to your plans and ambitions. And don't be surprised if those you help today go to bat for you later.",Saggitarius
"Oct 29, 2022 - Decisions regarding investments, savings, or other financial matters might need attention today, Sagittarius. Don't panic. You're in the right frame of mind for this. Your business sense is at an all-time high, as is your ability to focus on the task at hand. Intuition plays a strong role. Even if you don't feel like it, it's important to get this done. Tomorrow you might not be quite as focused as you are today.",Saggitarius
"Oct 30, 2022 - Emotions may cloud your thoughts as things start to heat up in a heavy way, Sagittarius. In an effort to keep things light and energetic, you may be missing the core of the situation. Don't glance too quickly over all the issues. The answer to the riddle is right there in front of you. Stop for a minute to catch your breath and you will find the solutions that you seek.",Saggitarius
"Oct 31, 2022 - There's a terrific expansive feeling to the day, Sagittarius, which you will appreciate more than anyone. For other people, this energy might expand into a headache. For you, it's apt to expand your feeling of success. It also might expand your stomach, so be careful that you don't overindulge. Other than that, don't hold back on your activities. Whatever you do will be very productive.",Saggitarius
"Nov 1, 2022 - At the end of the day, you're the one who has to look in the mirror and know who you are, Sagittarius. Think about this the next time you're tempted to make a rude comment or spread a displeasing fact about someone else. One side of you may be able to rationalize behavior that the other side simply despises. Today look at both of sides of yourself, not just the one that pleases you.",Saggitarius
"Nov 2, 2022 - Gossip and bad feelings among co-workers or in a group could occur today, and there might be some political shenanigans that it would be in your best interests to avoid. This isn't a good day to go to lunch with co-workers. Get away by yourself. Don't believe anything you hear. Chances are it isn't true. Keep to yourself and don't offer any opinions, Sagittarius. To do so might be unfortunate.",Saggitarius
"Nov 3, 2022 - It's very possible that you will want to take a step back today in order to take a closer look at your relationships. Your address book is full of names. Your phone rings off the hook. You receive tons of texts and emails every day. Yet isn't it funny that you feel alone? It's time to get rid of the superficial relationships and concentrate on those that really mean something to you.",Saggitarius
"Nov 4, 2022 - For you, Sagittarius, the changing planetary configuration portends a period of timidity. You will probably go out less, introduce yourself to fewer new people, and be less prone to show off. But any relationships you form will be much more intense than usual. The weeks ahead are quite promising, although you may have to readjust some of your attitudes.",Saggitarius
"Nov 5, 2022 - It looks as though you're about to hop on the bandwagon, Sagittarius. Friends will try to get you to support one of their causes. Think carefully. They aren't going to settle for a check. They want your hands-on support. While you might be intimidated by addressing a crowd, you always did want to use a megaphone. Volunteer for a night and see how it goes. You may enjoy it.",Saggitarius
"Nov 6, 2022 - Your ego may be under some stress today, Sagittarius. The tricky part is that the threat you feel is probably a result of something that isn't even completely real. It could be that someone is acting on false information that has no bearing on the reality of the situation. You might be swept away by someone else's false impression of who you really are.",Saggitarius
"Nov 7, 2022 - The mood may be oppressive today, Sagittarius. After meeting the challenges of the past several days, you're now in need of some well-deserved peace and quiet! Alas, the authorities are unwilling to give it to you. You can expect to be unceremoniously deposited at your desk. Work, it seems, won't wait until you've had a nap. Why not plan an exotic vacation for some point in the future?",Saggitarius
"Nov 8, 2022 - You will have to expect a few disturbances in the harmony that has reigned over the past few days, Sagittarius. For example, your needs may not match those of your mate or close friends, or you may feel restless. Minor worries about the future may intrude on people's good moods. In short, this won't be a good day to look to emotional harmony as a source of satisfaction.",Saggitarius
"Nov 9, 2022 - Do you feel as though your self-expression is being stifled, Sagittarius? Perhaps you need more time to choose a direction in life. Today, you can expect to feel a lot of pressure from someone close to you. You will feel forced to satisfy this person's demands. Annoying as this may be, you can take comfort in the knowledge that he or she has your best interests at heart.",Saggitarius
"Nov 10, 2022 - The last few weeks have been a little too serious for your tastes, but this is good for you every once in a while, Sagittarius. You may tend to want to play, which sometimes keeps you from getting your work done. Take today to try and get your daily life organized so you can have time to take care of your responsibilities and have a little fun.",Saggitarius
"Nov 11, 2022 - Your sensitive, sensual side is being drawn out, Sagittarius. You may feel like your romantic side is on display. You're like a dancer onstage, and you accept this role with pleasure! There's a great combination of energies at work letting you become more realistic about love and approach it with dramatic flair and courage. Be more expressive when it comes to your needs and desires.",Saggitarius
"Nov 12, 2022 - You have a very dynamic day ahead of you, Sagittarius. You may feel the need to put all your energy into a group project. You will want to roll up your sleeves and get to work. You're usually a meditative, pensive person, but today you're looking for concrete results and actions. Who knows? This hard work might even help you relax a little.",Saggitarius
"Nov 13, 2022 - Some fascinating conversations with friends, relatives, and others close to you could take place today, bringing new ideas your way, Sagittarius. You have both the physical energy and the inner power to make things happen, so you should make the most of it. Carefully consider your needs and aspirations and formulate a plan of action to make them a reality. The results might surprise you!",Saggitarius
"Nov 14, 2022 - Today you might toy with the idea of publishing, exhibiting, or otherwise making public whatever creative innovations you've been working on, Sagittarius. Spiritual information could come your way from afar, perhaps through friends or a group with which you're affiliated. Inspiration of all kinds could pop in and out of your head, so it might be best to write down your thoughts.",Saggitarius
"Nov 15, 2022 - Expect a boost in popularity today, Sagittarius. One way to put this to good use is to bring about change. Perhaps you and your co-workers feel that the workplace needs a new program, such as benefits. You'd be a good one to present this to the decision makers. Even if it's been done before, use your popularity to start a petition or find creative ways to make a group more effective.",Saggitarius
"Nov 16, 2022 - A little romantic time with your special someone may be in order today, Sagittarius. With the day-to-day chaos of working and living, it can be tough to get some quality time alone. If you don't make specific plans, it can be months before this happens. Take the situation in hand and make those plans. If you're single, consider making arrangements for a date or spending time with a friend, if possible.",Saggitarius
"Nov 17, 2022 - Your brain is buzzing in high gear, Sagittarius. Anyone else would get dizzy trying to process even a fraction of the things that filter through your head in one day. The key for you is to not speak every single thought aloud but to keep your processing internal. People want to hear your final decision, not the process you went through to reach it. You will save everyone a lot of time if you do.",Saggitarius
"Nov 18, 2022 - Perhaps you should suspend your inhibitions for the day, Sagittarius, and let your dreams guide you. For instance, you might imagine that the need to make any choices has vanished. Or you might grant yourself a vacation from daily chores. It would certainly be a relief. Who knows? You might conjure up some reality from the stuff of your dreams.",Saggitarius
"Nov 19, 2022 - People are going to think you're a star today, Sagittarius! Although you may not feel that way about yourself. What's gotten into you lately? Have you lost confidence in yourself? Are you now compensating for it? Do you feel a need for more success in your life? All this is possible, but you will have to take some risks if you're going to progress.",Saggitarius
"Nov 20, 2022 - Some people say that you miss out on life because of your tendency to observe your life rather than experience life directly. If that's the case, then today will be a real departure for you. You will suddenly seem more in contact with your sentiments and be more present and connected to those around you. It feels good for a change, doesn't it?",Saggitarius
"Nov 21, 2022 - The possibility of taking a trip by air could present itself today. The trip might be made with friends or a small group, if possible. If you've been working on projects connected with education or publishing, this is the day to move them forward. Books, TV, and the Internet could bring interesting, valuable information your way. This promises to be a busy, stimulating day.",Saggitarius
"Nov 22, 2022 - Are you feeling somewhat annoyed today? This is hardly surprising since the day inspires you to take a long, hard look at what's happening with your life. It's as though you suddenly realize that decisions you make may have impacts that reach far and wide. But don't let that stop you from committing yourself to a course of action, Sagittarius. Be adventurous!",Saggitarius
"Nov 23, 2022 - Things may happen right under your nose today, Sagittarius, and you may not even be aware of it. The thing that will be obvious is your reaction to the situation when this hidden event suddenly comes to light. A passionate explosion is likely, due to people's heightened emotional state. Try to work with this energy instead of against it.",Saggitarius
"Nov 24, 2022 - Worries about relatives or friends could plague you throughout the day, Sagittarius. Perhaps you aren't sure what's wrong and so you feel helpless. Whatever vague worries you may have, don't try to figure out the truth without knowing the facts. You could make mountains out of molehills. This isn't a good day to run errands. Delays and obstacles could cause a lot of frustration and wasted time.",Saggitarius
"Nov 25, 2022 - You'll want to jump into action today, Sagittarius. Feel free to order others around for a change and delegate. An aggressive approach is exactly what's called for, and you have the ability to deliver the goods. Trying to do everything yourself may seem like a great idea at first, but you're better off enlisting help so others can feel involved and you can concentrate on doing a better job on fewer tasks.",Saggitarius
"Nov 26, 2022 - There's no point in trying to make sense of today, Sagittarius. Much of what happens occurs on an unconscious level and defies any rational explanation. You may have had a dream last night worthy of professional interpretation. If you can bear turning off your intellect, this could be a very profitable day for you.",Saggitarius
"Nov 27, 2022 - Expect to be in a provocative mood today, Sagittarius. For the past few days, you may have been searching for an outlet for the overflowing energy you're so lucky to have. You will have an opportunity today, as innovative projects are likely to come your way. If you face your demons, you will find a unique opportunity to rid yourself of the fears you've been carrying around for so long.",Saggitarius
"Nov 28, 2022 - Things are going to get better and better for you as the day progresses, Sagittarius. Try to get your grounded, practical, and logical self collected during the day so you have the evening to socialize and commune with close friends, if possible. Balance is going to be a key issue for you today, so make sure you keep things in check before any one part of your life gets out of hand.",Saggitarius
"Nov 29, 2022 - Today is a good day for you to follow through, Sagittarius. Normally you're much better at tagging along or simply going with the flow of the situation. This way of doing things has proven quite effective for you in the past. Indeed, it has gotten you far. What you have now is a different situation. The things you've started will do you no good until you complete them.",Saggitarius
"Nov 30, 2022 - Today more than ever you will yearn to escape from the daily routine. You're thirsty for new sights and sounds, new faces and places. However, you're well aware that you must juggle your desires with your professional or domestic obligations. It isn't always easy, but you should trust your imagination to suggest a way to amicably settle this conflict.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Sagittarius, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",Saggitarius
"Dec 1, 2022 - Today your biorhythms may be a little low, Sagittarius, so you aren't likely to be feeling very sociable. You're more likely to want to bury your nose in your projects instead of being your usual outgoing self. This is OK but take care that you aren't so reclusive that you miss receiving some sincere compliments. That can make a big difference in the way you feel!",Saggitarius
"Dec 2, 2022 - Things regarding love and romance may be climactic for you now, Sagittarius, and you may bump heads with someone in a way that makes it difficult for either one of you to be content. More than likely there's an issue of freedom versus control that's making it difficult to find a resolution. Perhaps you need to give a certain issue a break and come back to it later.",Saggitarius
"Dec 3, 2022 - The expansive feeling you might be experiencing is apt to be squelched today as you get the feeling that you've lost touch with reality. Make sure you connect with real life, Sagittarius, and do a bit of planning to balance your whimsical nature. Things that you haven't accounted for might crop up and hit you, serving as a reminder that you need to deal with the here and now.",Saggitarius
"Dec 4, 2022 - You might find your emotions a bit dampened today, Sagittarius, but this may not be a bad thing. Try not to blow things out of proportion so much. Don't feel that you need to turn every small story into a major headline. There's no need to exaggerate the truth just to get more attention. Take a more reserved approach to your actions and reactions to all situations.",Saggitarius
"Dec 5, 2022 - This is one of those days in which it's easier to be yourself, Sagittarius. Don't feel like you need to change your personality to fit a situation. You naturally add an important dynamic to the group. Your detached, unbiased, and knowledgeable view of the situation will be an important asset to today's events. People would do well to listen to you, so be bold when expressing yourself.",Saggitarius
"Dec 6, 2022 - Do other countries represent real openings for you? This is a question that you will soon have to answer. This may be true, but it may also be an illusion that gives you a simplistic explanation for the dissatisfaction you feel now in your professional life. Think about it because some important decisions you're about to make depend on it. You aren't the only one to consider, either.",Saggitarius
"Dec 7, 2022 - Something's gotten into you today, Sagittarius. An iconoclastic imp inside you is determined to tear down every convention, especially in the art world. Why are you so furious with orthodoxy? Did you dream that an imitator stole one of your ideas and made a fortune with it? If you were an art critic, we would expect you to sing the praises of the vanguard.",Saggitarius
"Dec 8, 2022 - If you've been thinking about executing legal papers of any kind, Sagittarius, this isn't the day to do it. Any contract entered into today is likely to have confusing clauses and obscure language that you may not understand and that potentially could be used against you. This also isn't the day to start or even plan a journey of any kind. However, it's a great day for reading or meditation.",Saggitarius
"Dec 9, 2022 - A journey by air to a distant place might be on your mind, though you might not make it for a long time. Knowledge is important to you, and you can be insatiably curious. This is likely to be one of those days, Sagittarius. A friend or lover could bring some new information that sparks your curiosity, perhaps something related to astrology or the occult. You will want to pursue it.",Saggitarius
"Dec 10, 2022 - Unforeseen problems with travel plans could come up today, Sagittarius. There could be changes or delays in airline schedules, car breakdowns, or bad traffic. It might be a good idea to avoid travel of any sort if you can. It might stress you so much it would take you all day to calm down! This is a great day to stay in and read, especially about scientific or metaphysical subjects.",Saggitarius
"Dec 11, 2022 - Your heart and emotions are on the same page, Sagittarius, but they may not be on the page you want them to be. It could be that you're reminiscing about an event from the past. What was once a happy set of encounters now leaves you feeling like there are thorns in your side. Focus on the present and let the past become history.",Saggitarius
"Dec 12, 2022 - Use gadgets and electronic devices to make life easier today, Sagittarius. Why take the time to chop food by hand when you can use the food processor? Realize that there is most likely an easier way to tackle any task. If something seems too hard, ask for advice how to do the job more quickly and efficiently. Information exchange will play a big role in your day.",Saggitarius
"Dec 13, 2022 - The prevailing tone today is a mix of conflicting energies that might put some stress on your heart. It's nothing you can't handle, Sagittarius. In fact, if anyone can make the most out of today, you can. Tap into your aggressiveness and act boldly toward the object of your desire. Make sure there is harmony among those around you and everyone's needs are taken care of.",Saggitarius
"Dec 14, 2022 - Express yourself to the fullest today, Sagittarius. Feel free to take an unconventional approach when it comes to dealing with your emotions. Try not to let others cajole you into thinking you need to fit into an artificial construct of what you need to be and what you need to think. All you need to do is think for yourself. Fight the established norms and be your own person.",Saggitarius
"Dec 15, 2022 - You should be on cloud nine today, Sagittarius. As evening sets in, however, things might get a little too heavy for your comfort. People will have had enough of your gossip by then, so give it a rest. Kick back and plan for the next few days. You might also want to take a more serious approach to your romantic commitments by confirming your feelings about your partner now.",Saggitarius
"Dec 16, 2022 - You may have a hard time getting started today, Sagittarius. This might be a better time to plan. Be realistic and thoughtful in your actions. Be conscious of the steps you need to take to reach a certain goal. When in doubt, take the more conservative route. You will find that there is a great deal of support for that path. Don't get distracted along the way. Stay on target.",Saggitarius
"Dec 17, 2022 - Act with courage today, Sagittarius. Dress as if you were going to meet an important statesman. See yourself in the mirror and be proud to say you look good. Act with confidence and feel free to strut your stuff. Be up-front with your accomplishments, and let people know you're strong and trustworthy. Make sure you give many compliments, credit, and thanks to the people around you.",Saggitarius
"Dec 18, 2022 - Sagittarius, you may have been a little difficult to be around lately. You like to treat yourself to a little moodiness from time to time, but the people around you might appreciate a little cooperation. There are days when you don't want to grow up, when it's time to play. Do you get enough time to play? Think about it.",Saggitarius
"Dec 19, 2022 - You're highly sensitive and highly intellectual, Sagittarius. This is a wonderful combination and part of what makes you a superstar. Today's planetary positions challenge you to think how you can best combine these two key components of your personality. Have you considered writing? It might provide the sort of balance you seek. Start writing and see if it suits you.",Saggitarius
"Dec 20, 2022 - The atmosphere may seem a bit oppressive today, Sagittarius. You like to be free to do what you want to do, and it may bother you that the people around you don't make themselves available to you. They seem preoccupied by their own business. This could bring out some old wounds that haven't completely healed.",Saggitarius
"Dec 21, 2022 - You might second-guess yourself today, Sagittarius. Voices in your head are louder than usual, and you could be the one putting the brakes on your own train. Your intuition is trying to break through. See what you can do to slow down the chatter that continues to dictate the narrative throughout the day. Do more feeling instead of thinking. Give your mind a rest.",Saggitarius
"Dec 22, 2022 - You may feel a bit confused today. It might seem as if the wind has suddenly been taken out of your sails. Don't get discouraged by the slow weightiness of the day. Take the opportunity to relax and recharge your batteries. Do a bit of inward reflection as opposed to outer-directed movement. The most valuable lesson to learn is patience. Remind yourself of this throughout the day.",Saggitarius
"Dec 23, 2022 - You're on top of the world today, Sagittarius. Enjoy the view! You're unstoppable. Friends and family alike revel in your good mood. You're materially and spiritually generous, and by day's end people could be lined up to partake of the bounty. Try to curb your enthusiasm and use some discretion. It would be better to give more to a worthy few than give less to many.",Saggitarius
"Dec 24, 2022 - Sagittarius, you're bound to enjoy this day! It's full of possibilities and opportunities. It may begin routinely, but keep your eyes and ears open for hints of change. Your new adventure may come about in a mundane way. You might meet someone in line at the store who becomes a business partner. Or maybe you will meet a romantic interest at the ATM. Adventure is all around. Trust that you will find it!",Saggitarius
"Dec 25, 2022 - There's a very heavy atmosphere around you that might feel stifling, Sagittarius. Situations are cropping up that urge you to think practically with regard to your emotions. You will find that things go much more smoothly if you slow down and think about a situation before you proceed. Make sure you consider all the choices and what their effects will be on other people.",Saggitarius
"Dec 26, 2022 - Slow down a bit today and do some planning. There's a steady, grounded mood that will help bring your thoughts and actions down to Earth. The wind may not be filling your sails as much as you'd like, but you can use this to your advantage. The underlying reservation in people's attitudes and opinions will aid you quite a bit. Eliminate the fluff and concentrate on what's real.",Saggitarius
"Dec 27, 2022 - Sagittarius, your lighthearted attitude has given you a reputation as an eternal teenager. But levity is also a sign of a very wise person, a person who knows how to laugh at their wisdom. Whether you realize it or not, you can get involved in a serious relationship without losing your lightheartedness. If you're already in a committed relationship, you know how true this is.",Saggitarius
"Dec 28, 2022 - Are you going to be available to other people today? Someone in your entourage may need to confide in you. If the superficiality of the exchange bothers you, you will understand what the atmosphere of today is all about! Yes, you're available, but not for just anything. You're in no mood to waste time at the moment.",Saggitarius
"Dec 29, 2022 - Today is an inspirational day for you, fast thinking Sagittarius. Let those visions come to you, process them, and try to verbalize them. A lot of information and electricity is in the air, and you should have no problem picking up on it. Open up your channels for the best reception. Have a notepad handy to jot down all your insights.",Saggitarius
"Dec 30, 2022 - What ails you now can be eliminated if you're willing to stand up and say exactly what needs to be said, Sagittarius. Going with the flow may be an easy route to follow, but it might not always take you down a path that leads to the fulfillment of your dreams. Be a bit more aggressive about your position today and outwardly project yourself as the true master of your destiny.",Saggitarius
"Dec 31, 2022 - You may feel a great deal of nervous energy today, Sagittarius. Tension could come to you from all angles. Indecisiveness might be your biggest problem. You may be in a frenzy trying to figure out where to move next. The key is to slow down and relax. Don't make a move without evaluating things. Be careful about acting too hastily, especially when it comes to matters of the heart.",Saggitarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - No matter what friends tell you, Capricorn, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn

Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you wake up feeling super today, Capricorn. Chances are good that you'll feel a renewed physical strength with energy to spare. That said, it might be a good day to tackle any projects that require you to use some muscle. Perhaps there's some yard work that needs to be done or furniture you want to move around. On the fun side, you might want to get to the gym for a workout or swim. Whatever the activity, today is a good day to go for it!",Capricorn
"Feb 5, 2022 - You might feel cornered into doing something you just don't want to do today, Capricorn. Perhaps you made a promise to handle a project, or someone close to you has decided that it's the day to tackle something specific. Either way, if you're uncomfortable following through, communicate that to this person. Your ability to express yourself and be understood is enhanced with this day's energy. Rescheduling might be far better than any potential resentment.",Capricorn
"Feb 6, 2022 - You might get an unexpected visit today, Capricorn. And it's quite likely that it will be someone who really needs some comfort and support. Whether you have a huge list of things you want to get done or you were planning on just taking it easy, don't turn your friend away. Chores and hobbies will wait patiently for you, but lending care and support to someone in need often won't. Open your door and your heart if the situation arises.",Capricorn
"Feb 7, 2022 - It would be wise to spend some time thinking about your finances today, Capricorn. Do you have a realistic budget, or does yours exclude such things as entertainment, gifts, and occasional splurges? Such a budget won't suffice, because these are expenses that everyone has. Take a good look at your spending habits and see where you could cut back without too much pain.",Capricorn
"Feb 8, 2022 - You're likely to be feeling pretty energetic today, Capricorn, making it an opportune time to do some much-needed cleaning and organizing. Why not tackle those closets, attic, and storerooms? If you have to work, your desk, workspace, and filing cabinets could use a little attention. Just think how great it will feel when everything is in order! Make the most of your energy by accomplishing as much as you can.",Capricorn
"Feb 9, 2022 - Changes in your working environment could result in a rise in your income, Capricorn. You've been working very hard in order to advance yourself in this regard, and you’re likely to continue to do so indefinitely. Your natural communication skills continue to serve you well, and your physical energy is likely to be stronger than it has been for a long time. The only downside is having very little time to yourself! Hang in there!",Capricorn
"Feb 10, 2022 - Although you may have been feeling somewhat out of sorts for the past few days, Capricorn, today you could feel as if you just got a new lease on life. You’re in excellent physical, mental, and emotional shape, so you should be raring to go. Both immediate and long-term goals should be easy to achieve while your energy is strong today. Begin working on them; don't put them off. This high level of motivation should continue for a while.",Capricorn
"Feb 11, 2022 - News you may receive about your place of business or the people you work for might bring up some doubts about your future in this organization, Capricorn. You might feel that you aren't getting anywhere. You might be considering the possibility of changing jobs or even careers. Someone may put forth a type of opportunity that you've never considered before. Think about it, but don't decide for a few days.",Capricorn
"Feb 12, 2022 - You’ll find that your mind is sharp and penetrating today, Capricorn. Make sure you stay focused and organized. You have the power of discipline behind you that will help you manifest quite a bit on a day like today. Keep in mind that your openness to others and your incredible sensitivity are some of your greatest gifts. Use your power to create prosperity for yourself, but do it without hurting or manipulating others.",Capricorn
"Feb 13, 2022 - Some rather disturbing news about trends in the world economy could have you and everyone around you worrying about your financial future. Have faith, Capricorn. What you're hearing may be total misinformation. The future is probably going to shape up to be far different than the picture you draw from the news. In fact, you might find that your own personal finances take a definite turn for the better.",Capricorn
"Feb 14, 2022 - Today your level of imagination and intuition is especially high, Capricorn. Trust your heart today, especially where new projects and money are concerned. Insights may appear to knock at the doors of your conscious mind, yet it might take some deep thought to grasp their significance. Don't try to work it out through logic; it's best to let it all come to you. Then make use of logic to consider what you should do about it!",Capricorn
"Feb 15, 2022 - Insights that may come welling up from the past could be put to work for you in a positive way, Capricorn. You could use them as inspiration for a creative project of some kind, or you could just make them work for you in your day-to-day dealings with others. You should be feeling especially romantic and sexy today, and you might want to go shopping for clothes made of soft, touchable fabrics. Relations with lovers should be close and passionate.",Capricorn
"Feb 16, 2022 - You might wake up this morning feeling a little less than your usual self, Capricorn, and you might not be able to figure out why. There could be some sort of minor physical imbalance or you might be suffering from eyestrain. This could put you a little out of sorts with yourself and everyone else, particularly if you’re stressed about work responsibilities. Avoid computers, if possible, and take time during the day to run or go for a brisk walk.",Capricorn
"Feb 17, 2022 - Your intuition, imagination, and insight have served you well on the job, and should pay off soon. A raise, commission, or perhaps a chance to invest in the company could be offered to you. Your self-esteem will definitely receive a boost! You might also find that you’re growing even more intuitive than usual, and people are looking up to you because of it. Give yourself a pat on the back. You deserve it.",Capricorn
"Feb 18, 2022 - Worry about a family member may be on your mind today, Capricorn. This person could be all wrought up over work, money, or possibly a love affair that's broken off. Say whatever reassuring words you can muster, but don't expect him or her to respond, and don't fall into the trap of feeling that your kind words were all in vain. They did register. It's just going to take this person a while to come to terms with the situation.",Capricorn
"Feb 19, 2022 - You’re intuitive by nature, Capricorn, but today you’re likely to have a rush of psychic premonitions. Insights into your own character could bring old traumas to the surface so you can release them. Your dreams could be especially vivid and rather disconcerting, although not in a negative way. Write them down. Your aesthetic sense is also very high. Don't be surprised if you discover that you're rather partial to Impressionist art!",Capricorn
"Feb 20, 2022 - The fundraising activities of a group with which you're affiliated are going very well, Capricorn, but today you're likely to find that things seem to be stalled. Checks may not come in the mail, important people don't return your phone calls, or someone doesn't show up to do the job at hand. This situation is frustrating, but it probably won't last beyond today. By tomorrow you should all be your busy selves again. Hang in there!",Capricorn
"Feb 21, 2022 - There’s going to be so much to get done today that you might feel a little daunted about getting started. By midday you could even find yourself downright overwhelmed. Take a break, Capricorn. Take a long lunch on an outside terrace, weather permitting. Breathe deeply until the stress subsides. You may need to concentrate on finishing only one or two minor tasks today and put the rest off until tomorrow. Remember, too much stress can take its toll on your health!",Capricorn
"Feb 22, 2022 - You’re likely to receive a windfall of some sort today. Be cautious with it, Capricorn. If you invest it wisely, it will serve you long and well. Your curiosity has been piqued about some rather esoteric subjects, perhaps the dark arts. Why not visit your local library to check out some books on these topics of interest?",Capricorn
"Feb 23, 2022 - None of your friends may be at home today, Capricorn, and so you probably won't be able to have any phone conversations or visits with them. This could cause you to feel rather lonely. You might brood a little and convince yourself that no one cares about you any more. Snap out of it! You know full well this isn't the case. Read or watch videos until someone rings you up, and they will!",Capricorn
"Feb 24, 2022 - Your heart and intuition will rule today much more than your mind. Trust what your instincts tell you, Capricorn. If you’re in a sales profession, you can expect the orders to come rolling in today, as your extrasensory perception helps you know your clients' needs almost before they do. Plan a romantic encounter with someone you love, and put your ESP to work on him or her tonight.",Capricorn
"Feb 25, 2022 - Your creativity is at an all-time high today, Capricorn. You’re inspired to embark on some long-term creative projects, and you have the energy to see them through to the end. This is a time for you to take a leap of faith and plunge right in. Hesitation will get you nowhere. Whatever it is you’ve been dreaming of doing, do it now.",Capricorn
"Feb 26, 2022 - There could be a missing person very much on your mind these days. Is it possible that the relationship is over and you're the last one to know? Don't let your insecurities get the better of you, Capricorn. It's likely that your friend merely needs some time alone to sort out some big life issues. He or she will seek out your warmth and friendship again soon.",Capricorn
"Feb 27, 2022 - Have you been entertaining the idea of changing jobs, Capricorn? If so, put out some feelers today. You've been working hard and may have felt as if you've been barking up the wrong tree. Don't hesitate to research possibilities on the Internet, prepare your resume, and chat up knowledgeable people in social situations. It's time to pass carefully from reflection to action.",Capricorn
"Feb 28, 2022 - Without a doubt, there's a lot of work to be done around the house. With today's planetary configuration, you feel especially vested in making your home look its best. But you don't have to get everything done today, Capricorn. Rather than scrubbing floors and dusting furniture, why not invest in a few inexpensive items that will perk the place up a bit? A few area rugs and scatter pillows could make a big difference!",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2023 - No matter what friends tell you, Capricorn, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn

Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn
"Mar 1, 2022 - A task that you've been working on for a long time could come to a standstill today due to circumstances beyond your control. You're likely to feel quite frustrated, Capricorn, as there seems to be nothing you can do to speed things up. Don't agonize over this, however; it will get going again. The best thing you can do is find something else to work on until the blockages have been released.",Capricorn
"Mar 2, 2022 - Things might not feel like they're fitting into place today, Capricorn, so don't try to press the issue. You may sense a strong desire to escape into fantasyland and never come back. Resist the temptation to indulge in recreational substances that might leave you feeling more muddled than before. Get your work done and then let loose. Escape into the depths of your mind and explore what rich fantasies your inner self has to offer.",Capricorn
"Mar 3, 2022 - A group with which you're affiliated could be excited about a course of action that you might not feel is wise now, Capricorn. You might inform them of your reservations, but they're probably too charged up to listen. You could begin to have doubts about goals of your own that may be taking a long time to manifest. Hang in there. Sometimes things take longer than you'd like, but success is still in the wind.",Capricorn
"Mar 4, 2022 - Career and business continue to play a powerful role in your life now, as new ideas, new people, and considerations as mundane as modern equipment open up new doors for you, Capricorn. In addition, romantic involvements could intensify. If you're currently committed to someone, expect to grow closer. If you're involved but not exclusive, a proposal could be on the horizon. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if you meet someone new and exciting.",Capricorn
"Mar 5, 2022 - Your interest in certain off-the-wall topics may be encouraged when you're engaged in a conversation with someone who shares similar thoughts, Capricorn. Perhaps you exchange ideas about UFOs and life on other planets. Suddenly you're looking at your life as if you were a character in a science-fiction novel. Exchange books and other literature with those of a similar mindset. You may not be the only one who thinks there is a conspiracy against them.",Capricorn
"Mar 6, 2022 - This is a terrific day for you, Capricorn. You should find that your relationships, especially with men, go exceptionally well. Your tender and extremely sensitive nature is finally being recognized as the treasure chest it is. There are many times in which this type of personality is seen as weak, yet today is one of those times in which you're given the full credit you deserve.",Capricorn
"Mar 7, 2022 - In all the time spent trying to stabilize your emotions and achieve sensitivity, you may get too caught up in your feelings, Capricorn. Because of this, you may have not been listening to your rational mind lately, even though it's crying out for you to move forward to a different situation. Take some time to listen to your thoughts and take them more seriously than you have been.",Capricorn
"Mar 8, 2022 - A renewed sense of physical vigor could have you plunging with determination into whatever projects you need to do today. However, your mind won't really be on them, Capricorn, as you could be feeling especially passionate now. Your own intellectual and philosophical interests might be uppermost in your mind, right up there with sex and romance! That physical vigor could prove very pleasurable tonight. Enjoy your day.",Capricorn
"Mar 9, 2022 - Your actions may be touched by a very fanciful frame of mind today, Capricorn. Be careful about indulging in recreational substances that take you out of reality for a while. Your tendency will be to escape into the cosmos, but sooner or later you'll have to come down. Deal with your issues now before your thinking becomes even more clouded than before. Take action with a clear and sober mind.",Capricorn
"Mar 10, 2022 - Debates over philosophy, religion, and education are likely to turn into all-out war. Feel free to add your two cents, Capricorn. This is one time in which it's crucial to stand up for what you believe or else the loudest people will have their way. If there is a protest going on, join it. If there is an article in the newspaper you disagree with, write a letter to the editor. Speak your mind.",Capricorn
"Mar 11, 2022 - Try to come to a place of serenity today in which you free yourself from desire and jealousy, Capricorn. It's important that you take time to recognize the incredible growth that can spring from this position of calm and pure satisfaction. Rid yourself of the excess baggage that you cling to as some sort of support or means of comfort. The less you carry, the more you free up your arms to create.",Capricorn
"Mar 12, 2022 - There is a great deal of startup energy working for you today, Capricorn. You may feel as if you're walking on hot coals. This isn't a good day to sit on the couch watching TV. The coals will burn you for sure. It's important that you keep moving. Engage in activities that exercise your mind as well as body. You'll feel much better if you can point to something and say that you created it.",Capricorn
"Mar 13, 2022 - Expect some very pleasant surprises today, Capricorn. If you're single, you're likely to receive a phone call from someone who interests you romantically. This should greatly increase your level of self-confidence, and you're therefore likely to float through the rest of the day. With these aspects, any new relationship or project begun today will have a wonderful energy behind it.",Capricorn
"Mar 14, 2022 - Today is good for entertaining, Capricorn. Enjoy the company of family and friends, and don't get distracted by gloomy thoughts about work or money. Just relax and let others take care of themselves. You enjoy nurturing other people and making sure they have a wonderful time, but you need to have a great time as well, so don't work too hard. Someone may give you a gift, a token of love and appreciation.",Capricorn
"Mar 15, 2022 - Conflict between your responsibilities at home and career obligations, particularly those involving partners, could pose a problem today, Capricorn. The problem isn't insurmountable, but does call for honest, open communication among all parties involved. You won't be happy at having to make a choice, and may find the two duties difficult to balance right now. Give it your best. By tomorrow things should be back to normal.",Capricorn
"Mar 16, 2022 - You could think that your life is too boring for anyone else to care about, Capricorn. Don't fall into a well of self-pity and convince yourself that there simply isn't enough excitement in your life and never will be. Believe that you have the power to cure any such downtrodden feeling that you might have at this time. Consider joining a spiritual support group where you can honestly share your feelings.",Capricorn
"Mar 17, 2022 - Partnerships, possibly business related, are on the agenda, Capricorn. You might find yourself in discussions dealing with such partnerships, as well as contracts and other paperwork. You might also set aside time during which you can concentrate on a romantic relationship, a new one or current one that's changing and growing. This is a good time to make decisions, as your mind is particularly focused now.",Capricorn
"Mar 18, 2022 - You may find that people aren't necessarily very sympathetic to your feelings today, Capricorn. It's quite possible that they're more responsive to facts and information than emotions. It could be that you need to enlist some sort of translator in order to get through to a person with whom you're trying to communicate. Don't hesitate to ask for more clarification on something if you need it.",Capricorn
"Mar 19, 2022 - Plans for getting together with a group of close friends may have to be called off because of sudden unexpected events. This could have you feeling somewhat down, Capricorn, especially if a romantic partner is involved. Try not to worry about it too much. You will be able to reschedule, and you could use the time alone anyway to relax and center yourself.",Capricorn
"Mar 20, 2022 - You've got a lot on your mind right now, Capricorn, and others might be interpreting your quiet behavior as your being aloof. Go right ahead and let them think whatever they want. You've got some real issues to think through, and decisions with important consequences to come up with. You'll be able to smooth their ruffled feathers later. Right now, just focus on taking care of yourself.",Capricorn
"Mar 21, 2022 - Your natural sensitivity and compassion are given a powerful impetus today by strong feelings of love and affection for everyone around you, Capricorn. Therefore, you're likely to give and receive a lot of expressions of affection, both overt and subtle. A significant other should feel especially romantic toward you, so relax and let him or her shower you with attention. Children could also prove a powerful source of support.",Capricorn
"Mar 22, 2022 - Business-oriented social events could take up a lot of your time today, Capricorn. You could either be planning or attending them. If the latter, however, it could well be more than one. You're feeling especially outgoing at this time, so you should make a good impression and possibly even make a few new friends. However, it's also important to remember to take some time for yourself.",Capricorn
"Mar 23, 2022 - Some rather extensive and annoying paperwork might need to be dealt with, Capricorn. It will probably require all your attention, so if you can, take care of it first thing in the morning when you're still fresh. This might be a contract or it could be an insurance policy or something else full of unintelligible jargon. Don't be afraid to ask someone familiar with it to explain the language to you.",Capricorn
"Mar 24, 2022 - Phone calls and emails between you and your friends may get misplaced or otherwise go astray, Capricorn. A little patience is called for when trying to reach anyone at this time, especially if modern technology is involved. If a matter is urgent, it might be best to do the old-fashioned thing and actually go see the person in question. That's the only way to ensure reaching anyone right now.",Capricorn
"Mar 25, 2022 - Work on projects that require imagination and sensitivity could well take up a lot of your time today, Capricorn. Some in-depth research may be involved. The work might require a lot of energy and concentration, perhaps more than you expected, but you should be more than satisfied with the results in the end. Just make sure to take breaks, and don't forget to eat. You'll need the fuel, after all!",Capricorn
"Mar 26, 2022 - You've been extremely busy these past few months, working extra hours at the office, then going out with friends late at night. This sort of behavior is known as ""burning the candle at both ends,"" and it rarely has a happy ending, Capricorn. You need to take some quiet time, ideally with someone special. It's likely that your romantic partner misses you and would jump at the opportunity to spend an intimate evening with you.",Capricorn
"Mar 27, 2022 - You could have some strange, mystical dreams tonight, Capricorn, possibly involving angels or other spiritual beings. Their messages could well shed light on a romantic relationship that you might not understand well. Keep a notebook by your bed so you can write down the details of the dreams as soon as you awaken. You'll want to consider them very carefully to see if you can figure out what's going on.",Capricorn
"Mar 28, 2022 - Relationships of all kinds become stronger and more enduring today, Capricorn. Successes boost the strength of business partnerships; love relationships advance to the next level of commitment. Bonds of any kind formed now are likely to be strong ones, marked by honesty, loyalty, and affection.

"Mar 29, 2022 - Some beautiful dreams or visions, perhaps involving angels, spirit guides, or other such beings, could come today, Capricorn. Listen carefully to the messages they bring. Whether they involve matters in your material life, intellectual or spiritual concerns, or future events, they can shed light on a lot of facts about you of which you might not be aware. Write them down as soon as you can. You'll be glad you did.",Capricorn
"Mar 30, 2022 - Someone you know from work could suddenly seem to have romantic feelings for you, Capricorn. At first this might make you a little uncomfortable, since you've never thought of this person in that way before. Don't do anything rash. Think about it first. Maybe there's potential, maybe not, but don't jump at it or dismiss it out of hand. Who knows? This person could prove to be your ideal mate!",Capricorn
"Mar 31, 2022 - You probably won't feel like working today, Capricorn. You may not be tired, but you're probably bored, restless, and unable to focus. It's best to concentrate on routines or mundane chores you can do automatically on days like this. Put on your headphones. Take a long, leisurely lunch or perhaps brunch with friends. It's important to have some fun. Think of it as an exercise to balance your usually serious self!",Capricorn
"Apr 1, 2022 - Your sensitive nature is likely to pick up a disturbance in your thinking today, Capricorn. Suddenly, a blast of unexpected information could come your way and throw a monkey wrench in your mental process. Try not to get thrown off balance by the sudden jolt. You'll find that you can incorporate some of this new knowledge in a way that gives you a greater advantage.",Capricorn
"Apr 2, 2022 - You could lapse into pessimism, Capricorn. Suddenly the glass appears half empty and everything looks bleak. You feel like you're going around in circles. You might ask yourself what you're doing it all for anyway. You can talk yourself out of this mood as easily as you talked yourself into it. It might not seem possible, but you must trust that it's necessary in order to see the glass as half full again.",Capricorn
"Apr 3, 2022 - One whiff of a familiar scent is likely to send your imagination running wild, Capricorn. Perhaps you're suddenly transported back to when you were dating someone you adored. Once your imagination starts running, it could be difficult to slow it down. Your fantasy world is likely to be the safest place to hide, so don't worry about avoiding reality. Keep playing in the past if that's where you'd rather be today.",Capricorn
"Apr 4, 2022 - There is a lot on your mind today, Capricorn. Over the last three weeks you've analyzed your relationships on a deep and profound level. New people with attractive qualities could be tempting you to make a change. But is this a good time in your life to start up friendships or love relationships? Are you willing to accept the upheaval such changes would create? These are worthwhile questions to ask.",Capricorn
"Apr 5, 2022 - These past three weeks were rather good for your equilibrium, Capricorn. It was just a matter of getting a bit more involved in life than is usual for you, and showing what you're capable of. It's likely you had a mixture of successes and setbacks, but on the whole, improvements have been steady. You might have noticed that something about you needed improvement, but isn't that true for everyone?",Capricorn
"Apr 6, 2022 - An unexpected financial setback could have you reeling at first, Capricorn. Perhaps an emergency, such as a toothache or car breakdown, requires a substantial expenditure that you hadn't planned for. You can probably find a way to deal with the crisis. You may have resources to draw upon that you aren't aware of now. Go over all your finances and you could be pleasantly surprised. Hang in there!",Capricorn
"Apr 7, 2022 - Today you and the other members of your household might discuss the possibility of making some changes, Capricorn. This could involve some redecorating or remodeling or even something as mundane as a thorough cleaning. However, it could also involve the possibility of moving to a completely different place. The need for change in your surroundings is apparent, so don't hesitate. Go ahead and initiate the first steps!",Capricorn
"Apr 8, 2022 - You might want to spend most of today outside, Capricorn, perhaps taking a walk through a park. You could have some serious thinking to do and feel the best recourse is to be by yourself for a while. Decisions won't come easily today, so don't try to force them. Just enjoy being out in the fresh air. Sometimes things come together more quickly if you forget about them for a while.",Capricorn
"Apr 9, 2022 - Usually you enjoy talking with others, Capricorn, but today you won't even want to answer the phone. Your physical stamina and mental energy are low, and you could feel out of sorts. It might help if you go for a walk sometime in the afternoon. You won't want to waste your evening lying around the house. Get the endorphins going and then go to a movie. You'll soon be your old self again!",Capricorn
"Apr 10, 2022 - Communication between you and either a business or romantic partner should get a fresh start today, Capricorn. You've gotten to know each other better and feel more comfortable being honest and open with each other than before. All signs are that any partnerships begun, renewed, or confirmed today are likely to be successful and profitable. Bear this in mind in future months when you hit the rough spots!",Capricorn
"Apr 11, 2022 - Some vivid, inspiring, and intense dreams or visions could come your way today, Capricorn. They could involve paranormal figures, such as angels. Make sure you keep a record of them, as your higher self is trying to tell you something. Make a list of all the images you can remember and analyze what these images symbolize to you. You could come up with some profound insights about the world and yourself.",Capricorn
"Apr 12, 2022 - A particularly tricky situation could occur at work. If you aren't careful, you could lose your cool. Make a concerted effort to keep your wits about you, Capricorn. It could be that a colleague is baiting you, but that's no reason to take it. Keep to yourself as much as possible today. Close your office door. At home, go to bed early. Relax with a good book. All will be calmer tomorrow.",Capricorn
"Apr 13, 2022 - Love and romance are definitely on the agenda for today, Capricorn, and you should be feeling warm, passionate, and particularly sexy. You're likely to be looking quite attractive, too, and romantic partners or potential partners could seem especially attractive to you. This is a wonderful day to shop for new clothes, have your hair styled, or prepare a candlelit dinner for someone very special. Go for it!",Capricorn
"Apr 14, 2022 - Technology is going to play a big role in your life today and in the immediate future, Capricorn. It could be that your office is upgrading its systems and you're in charge of getting everyone up to speed on the new equipment. Or it's possible that you'll decide to take a class to increase your technical knowledge. One thing is clear - you're likely to achieve extraordinary success through the use of technology.",Capricorn
"Apr 15, 2022 - You might find yourself wrestling some ongoing, unresolved issues that could interfere with your ability to do your job. Be mindful that you're a bit brittle today, particularly if you're working on financial matters, Capricorn. The last thing you want is a major battle with those around you, so do your best to keep a cool head. Don't let uncontrolled emotions rule the day.",Capricorn
"Apr 16, 2022 - Don't take anything you read or hear today at face value, Capricorn. It's possible that you'll receive some rather distressing news, but before you react in frustration, read the fine print. The news may not really be so bad. In fact, it may not even be true! Take a deep breath and heave a sigh of relief, then get back to your normal routine.",Capricorn
"Apr 17, 2022 - All financial undertakings have good aspects today, Capricorn. It could be that you have been thinking of starting a new business venture. If so, you're likely to meet the ideal business partner. Keep your eyes and ears tuned as you go about your daily routine. You never know when you might be introduced to that one special person you need in your life. Socialize in the evening with good friends.",Capricorn
"Apr 18, 2022 - Today you could feel overwhelmed with obligations and commitments to others. There isn't a moment free for yourself, not even for a bathroom break! Clearly, something's out of balance, Capricorn. It's time to take charge of your life. It's wonderful that you have such a giving, generous spirit, but you do no one any favors if you burn out from exhaustion. Take some time to refill the well of your soul.",Capricorn
"Apr 19, 2022 - Take advantage of the lighthearted, flighty feeling of the day instead of getting annoyed by it, Capricorn. You can't hide in your bedroom forever. Well, you could, but you'd end up wasting away and no one would even notice. This is a good day to get out and have fun with friends. Make wishes for people instead of cursing them. Make connections. Remember to laugh as often as possible.",Capricorn
"Apr 20, 2022 - Staying in touch with a love partner could be difficult today, Capricorn, almost to the point of causing a minor panic. Don't jump to any unwarranted conclusions about possible problems in the relationship. What's causing the silence is probably beyond your friend's control, and could well be related to sudden and unexpected crises, or possibly something as mundane as a computer breakdown. Be patient and hang in there.",Capricorn
"Apr 21, 2022 - You tend to be intuitive by nature, Capricorn, but today you could receive psychic impressions by the dozen. You might even experience visions or hear voices. Don't worry – you aren't going crazy! You do, however, need to pay attention to these messages. They may have immense personal or even planetary significance. If you can't make sense of them, write them down. It should all be clear to you later.",Capricorn
"Apr 22, 2022 - A sum of money that you might have been expecting from far away may be delayed, Capricorn. This could be frustrating for you, but don't panic. The money is indeed coming. So unless your situation is urgent, just sit back and wait. If you want to check with those who are sending it, by all means do so. However, you'll probably find that the matter is out of their hands. Be patient and hang in there.",Capricorn
"Apr 23, 2022 - This would be a good day to stay home and spend much of the day in bed, Capricorn! You've been working especially hard lately, juggling both home and work with your usual aplomb. But today you could feel a bit worn out and overwhelmed by everything that remains to be done. Give yourself a day of rest. Spend the day with a good book or some movies. You'll find this solitary time refreshing.",Capricorn
"Apr 24, 2022 - Sometimes it's easier to tend to life's mundane details rather than lift your eyes and see the big picture, Capricorn. For example, it's likely that you've grown complacent at work. Could it be that you aren't at the right job or in the right career after all? Busying yourself with trivia isn't the way to avoid answering the question. It's imperative that you face it head on and make the necessary changes.",Capricorn
"Apr 25, 2022 - Throughout the day you may get the feeling that something has changed in the way people relate to each other, Capricorn. It will be as if people are surer of themselves, more open, more expressive. Where, exactly, do you fit into all of this? Are you in a mood to charm other people just for fun? This period is perfect for taking care of your appearance and getting in shape. Do it!",Capricorn
"Apr 26, 2022 - You could be feeling playful today, Capricorn. Your romantic partner will certainly appreciate your fun-loving mood. Why not plan a fun day together doing something other than your usual routine? Rather than dinner and a movie, how about lunch and a visit to a museum or art gallery? You have both been working very hard lately. Your relationship will benefit from an injection of spontaneity.",Capricorn
"Apr 27, 2022 - Today doubts, uncertainties, and insecurities could plague a love relationship, Capricorn. Does your beloved share your passion? Is your friend being honest and open with you? Does this relationship have a future? The only way to get past this inner turmoil is to take one step at a time and take a good long look at the results of each step. Only in this way will your doubts be resolved one way or the other.",Capricorn
"Apr 28, 2022 - Today you might find yourself hosting an impromptu social event, Capricorn, and more people could show up than you initially counted on. Don't worry about it, however. The party should be enjoyable for everyone even if the place is a bit crowded. Your visitors can look out for themselves. Among the unexpected guests might be an attractive, interesting person who could shape up to be a potential love partner. Relax and enjoy your day.",Capricorn
"Apr 29, 2022 - Paperwork involving money could be a real drag for you today, Capricorn. You'll have to get it done, but you'd rather be elsewhere. It might also seem a little confusing. If you get to it early and concentrate, you should finish it quickly and then get on to what you want to do. After a morning of intense, tedious work, you'll probably be ready for some entertainment like a movie or sports event. Have fun!",Capricorn
"Apr 30, 2022 - It might seem like you no longer completely believe in what you're doing, Capricorn, perhaps because you've been going a little too quickly in your quest to get what you need. It's very possible that your social life has slowed down a lot now - just when you decided to go full speed in this domain. Surprising what the astral energy can do, isn't it? Don't get upset. You can't do a thing about it.",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2023 - No matter what friends tell you, Capricorn, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn
"May 1, 2022 - You don't have to create everything alone, Capricorn. Life isn't an individual sport. To live life fully, you must participate. Often this involves interacting with other people. This is an exercise in confidence. Do you want to be with us - yes or no? Regardless of your answer, outside events will lead you in a direction that you can neither predict nor imagine.",Capricorn
"May 2, 2022 - Your concept of reality could be based more on your emotions than facts, Capricorn. This is one of those days when this could get you into trouble. Whatever comes up, you're likely to feel very passionate about it and tend to lose any rational perspective whatsoever. Integrity, inner strength, and self-confidence will be the glue that holds your mind and heart together.",Capricorn
"May 3, 2022 - The planets want to make a deal with you today, Capricorn. Either you stay in bed fantasizing about life as a CEO or rock star or you get up, get dressed, and do what you have to do to make your dreams come true. Try and convince yourself once and for all that you don't have to lose your childlike wonder when you enter the real world. That never goes away, no matter how old you get!",Capricorn
"May 4, 2022 - A friend might be feeling a little depressed today and need some cheering up. Social events or group activities could be of great help in doing that, and it would do you some good as well, Capricorn. A long-term goal may finally be reached, justifying a celebration. Interacting with a group could take up a lot of your time and concentration, but take care not to get too tired.",Capricorn
"May 5, 2022 - The opportunity to travel, perhaps with friends or a group you belong to, could come your way today, Capricorn. Discussions with others could lead to the confirmation of practical arrangements. You might also seek to advance your education, as your intellect is especially active now. Whatever new experiences come your way could lead to new paths, interests, and opportunities. Don't let doubts or fears get in your way.",Capricorn
"May 6, 2022 - Things could be moving more quickly than makes you comfortable right now, Capricorn. You may feel as if your own needs and agenda are getting lost in the fury bubbling around you. The secret key to add to your toolbox is the ability to go with the flow. It's crucial to be adaptable and roll with the punches rather than be victimized by them. Use the lightning-quick energy at hand to mobilize your efforts.",Capricorn
"May 7, 2022 - Love is very real to you. You're apt to take it very seriously, perhaps even too seriously, Capricorn. This is one of those emotions that eventually takes over your brain and leaves no room for rational thoughts on the topic. The good news is that matters regarding love and romance should be stabilizing at this time, giving you the opportunity to face this area of your life from a rational perspective.",Capricorn
"May 8, 2022 - It's going to be a little difficult talking to you today, Capricorn. You, who can be easily influenced by others, will be listening to and criticizing everything that people say. Nothing emotional or vague is going to get into your head. It's as if you've installed an extremely fine filter that lets in only what you allow. You're going to appear to be a real expert. Don't show off too much!",Capricorn
"May 9, 2022 - Today is a good day to organize professional or personal meetings. They will be productive. It's an auspicious time for efficient, serious communication, realistic plans, and group harmony. All the ingredients for success and true advancement are available. Don't be surprised if you're the one in charge. You're especially good at creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere.",Capricorn
"May 10, 2022 - Today you could feel a little more vulnerable than usual, Capricorn. Perhaps you feel hemmed in by decisions you can't put off any longer. Or you could be a little overworked and overwhelmed by all your activities. If only your children could be a little more independent! The day ahead will help you make some decisive progress. No backward glances allowed! Dwelling on the past won't help you at all.",Capricorn
"May 11, 2022 - If by chance you still harbor some resentment toward someone, Capricorn, it will probably come out today. You might be uncompromising or even vengeful. Telling that person how you feel will accomplish nothing other than cause you both pain and regret. Vent your anger in a healthy way, such as some form of intense physical activity. Besides, this person really means what they've been saying. That's right, they do care about you.",Capricorn
"May 12, 2022 - An opportunity to travel with a partner or colleague could come your way, perhaps for business. Any travel planned or begun today is likely to go well and bring you whatever results you hope for. Whatever it is you're planning, Capricorn, it should excite your enthusiasm and optimism for your future success. Business and personal relations with others should be warm, cordial, and stimulating. Make the most of it!",Capricorn
"May 13, 2022 - Today's aspects might clear up some rather sketchy ideas about your professional future, Capricorn. If you long for a change, such as daring to undertake a more artistic pursuit, now is the time to begin planning exactly how to go about it. The first step is to figure out how you can make a living from it. Welcome back to reality!",Capricorn
"May 14, 2022 - You might want to check your alarm clock to be sure it really woke you up this morning, Capricorn. Your tendency will be to stay in the cocoon of your own little dream world, deep in your own thoughts. Obsessive thoughts, in particular, will try and drown out some more pressing issues from the past that really need to be dealt with once and for all. ""Ring, ring!"" It's time to wake up!",Capricorn
"May 15, 2022 - These last few weeks have been good for your equilibrium, Capricorn. It was a question of becoming a bit more involved in life than usual, and showing what you're capable of. Most likely you had a mixture of successes and setbacks, but on the whole, improvements have been steady. You may have noticed that this or that about yourself needs improvement, but isn't that true for everyone?",Capricorn
"May 16, 2022 - Your head is filled with passion today, Capricorn, and you may be feeling a bit more sentimental than usual. The one difficulty with this is that there may not be an appropriate situation in which to express this emotion as fully as you might like. Try to navigate the waters toward a safe place where the people around you support you. Avoid those who might want to pop your bubble.",Capricorn
"May 17, 2022 - If you've always felt the desire to write, now is the time to take the plunge, Capricorn. You certainly don't lack the imagination! Your problem may be that you have difficulty taking your prose seriously. Don't think about being “A Writer.” Just write! And above all, don't hesitate to let people read what you write. A writer's group would be a great way for you to come out of hiding.",Capricorn
"May 18, 2022 - With today's celestial energy, you're going to feel like you're on vacation, Capricorn. This planetary configuration often gives people the feeling of having a fresh mind and calm disposition. Problems that once seemed so complicated now appear simple and surmountable. You could also have some fun writing. Try it. You may be surprised by the results.",Capricorn
"May 19, 2022 - Your ego and physical vitality should experience a boost today, Capricorn. Try to hone in on the solid, grounding energy that's encouraging you to come to terms with your emotions. Be aware of the fact that your often gloomy attitude may be starting to weigh heavily on the ones you love. Be careful that you aren't hurting someone just because you know that they'll forgive you.",Capricorn
"May 20, 2022 - You should be able to put on your famous smile this morning and keep it on all day, Capricorn. Advertise your beautiful soul to the world. If other people are sad, it's fine to sympathize, but don't bear their ailments for them. Keep up a bit of a shield to protect yourself from this energy. At the same time, you want to keep a window open so other people can see you from the inside.",Capricorn
"May 21, 2022 - You may feel that you've made real progress in your relationships, Capricorn. And you're right to feel this way. ""Evolution"" best defines the path you're on right now. You can be proud of yourself, because the work you do on an individual level is the best way for you to contribute to the development of society. This way of taking action is no less important than the work done by global organizations.",Capricorn
"May 22, 2022 - Your actions today could take an investigative approach, Capricorn. You're able to probe much more deeply than usual as you search people's eyes for the answers you seek. Feel free to take aggressive action based on your gut instincts. Use your powerful emotions as a tool instead of something that holds you back. People may come to you for advice, and you're in the perfect position to give it.",Capricorn
"May 23, 2022 - You may feel a bit of strain today as you try to figure out the best way to get to where you need to be, Capricorn. On the one hand, the happy approach calls for you to let loose, be courageous, and strike out with conviction toward the things that mean the most to you. On the other, a sense of duty holds you back. Take the best of both worlds. Come up with your own plan of attack.",Capricorn
"May 24, 2022 - You will sail through this day on the gentlest of breezes, Capricorn. It's like you've just come back from a week in the country. You're calm, refreshed, and relaxed, and no amount of trouble at work can shake the feeling. You see things in a more positive light. Problems that once seemed insurmountable now resolve themselves almost without your help. Lucky you!",Capricorn
"May 25, 2022 - You might find that words aren't the best way to communicate today, Capricorn. Body language and the sense of touch and taste are much more effective. You'll find that your senses will be heightened overall. The smell of the restaurant several blocks away could make your taste buds water. Give in to your senses and let your feet follow your nose. Go enjoy a good meal tonight with someone special.",Capricorn
"May 26, 2022 - It could be that you've been losing faith in your dreams and fantasies lately, Capricorn. Now is the time to refocus on what you want and move forward with confidence. You've done enough reflecting and reviewing. It's time to implement and create. Dream big and don't let others stand in the way of your progress. Today's shift may be subtle, but it should indicate smooth sailing for the next few weeks.",Capricorn
"May 27, 2022 - Things should go especially well for you today, Capricorn, so don't worry about a thing. Life doesn't necessarily get easier as you get older. You just learn how to deal with things. You'll find this to be true right now as your incredible sensitivity and wisdom are making it possible for you to attain a clearer perspective. You realize that things are much better than you may have thought.",Capricorn
"May 28, 2022 - If you feel suffocated by your romantic relationships, if you feel they lack some spice or are too traditional, then why not liberate yourself? There is a feeling in the air that life is turning in a positive direction. This will help you set things up to turn even your craziest ideas into reality. Starting today, Capricorn, you're going to be asked to be more concrete.",Capricorn
"May 29, 2022 - The masculine and feminine sides of your personality should be working together well today, Capricorn. The key is to keep the energy moving. Try not to stagnate on any one issue. Use your words and nurturing abilities to soothe others' worries. Actively direct your energy outward with the tender sensitivity that you possess within. Your inner strength is one of your most valuable resources.",Capricorn
"May 30, 2022 - Come out of your shell today, Capricorn. You'll notice that people are much more sensitive to your feelings because they seem to be more emotional themselves. Communication is likely to occur more through unspoken channels than traditional methods, which is interesting at a time when most conversations are happening through electronic media. Do your best to let others know that you're listening to them.",Capricorn
"May 31, 2022 - You may feel like you're rubbing against sandpaper today, Capricorn. It's probably a result of deep issues within yourself, possibly aggravated by the constant tension between old and new energies clashing within your world. This is one of those days in which things come to a head. Pieces of your inner being are hitting you square in the face. Blame it all on the COVID-19 crisis, treat yourself gently, and try again tomorrow.",Capricorn
"Jun 1, 2022 - Group activities prove beneficial on several levels, Capricorn. You might project powerful warmth and love for all life. You're feeling especially optimistic about the future. Your enthusiasm could spill over to others, attracting them into your aura. Acquaintances become friends, friends grow closer, and love relationships grow stronger and more stable. You could gain a lot of intriguing, useful information, particularly about the arts.",Capricorn
"Jun 2, 2022 - Though you naturally tend to be sensitive to the feelings of others, Capricorn, today you might be so in touch with the needs and desires of those around you that you sense what they want even before they know it. Spiritual, emotional, or psychological insights might come to you throughout the day. You could even have some prophetic dreams. Write down whatever seems particularly significant. You'll want to remember it later.",Capricorn
"Jun 3, 2022 - A desire to do some redecorating, perhaps in anticipation of hosting a future social event, might prove frustrating today. You probably have some definite ideas, Capricorn, but can't find the materials you need to produce the results you want. Whatever you're planning, it might be a good idea to phone around in advance and see what resources are available. It could save you some frustration.",Capricorn
"Jun 4, 2022 - Although business and money matters continue to go well, some rather unsettling news regarding either your finances or the economy in general could reach you today, Capricorn. However, don't accept as truth anything you hear until you check the facts. The planetary energies now lend themselves to the spread of rumor, gossip, and misinformation. This is definitely the day to hang on to your objectivity.",Capricorn
"Jun 5, 2022 - Communicating with loved ones might prove especially intellectually and emotionally gratifying at this time, Capricorn. Relationships with old friends grow stronger, and new friends may also come onto the scene. Among them might be people in your profession. Through them you might learn of new opportunities to advance your career. Expect an inspiring story of some kind to move you to tears. Don't fight it.",Capricorn
"Jun 6, 2022 - Expect to spend a lot of time communicating with others, perhaps texting multiple friends at one time either individually or in a group chat. At least one could end up being helpful to your professional life. A lot of stimulating conversation could take place today, Capricorn, perhaps giving you clues to opportunities or trends that you want to follow. Relations with others should be jovial, congenial, and supportive.",Capricorn
"Jun 7, 2022 - Business and money matters may seem too good to be true, Capricorn. Success and good fortune in these departments are definitely indicated for you today. If you've been trying to get a break in a creative or artistic field, it may finally manifest. The present looks profitable and the future bright. In the evening, celebrate by scheduling a romantic encounter with your lover, if possible. You should find it especially gratifying now.",Capricorn
"Jun 8, 2022 - If it were up to you, you'd rather stay in bed reading than confront the world. Deep inside, however, you know you need to reach out to others. You feel that you can't be left out of society. But have you ever thought about finding someone who shares your tastes? You could read in bed with someone else and still have a lot of contact.",Capricorn
"Jun 9, 2022 - Have you been working yourself too hard and denying yourself many of the pleasures that you see others enjoying that you'd like to have? Is there a new pair of shoes calling to you from your favorite online store that you just can't let yourself buy? Indulge yourself today. You won't regret it. It's important that you not confuse an object's price with its value. Think about it.",Capricorn
"Jun 10, 2022 - Nothing much is happening today, yet you seem worried and tense. You'll have to use this day to your advantage. Think about your life. You'll also think about the needs of your relatives in the years to come and how to attain those goals. You'll also be in the best disposition to think about your own family life.",Capricorn
"Jun 11, 2022 - Your intuition is usually very strong, Capricorn, and your level of empathy enhances your relationships. Today, however, a burst of logic could enable you to see many things in a different light. This adds a new dimension to your communicative abilities and could prove valuable in bringing you closer to the ones you love the most. It can also increase your understanding of yourself.",Capricorn
"Jun 12, 2022 - Today should prove to be a wonderful day, Capricorn. Your physical energy is good, and you should be looking and feeling wonderful. Though you'll probably want to spend most of the day at home, you're likely to attract lots of interesting people in intriguing fields into your aura. Your ability to express your feelings is also high, so expect some stimulating conversations about whatever strikes your fancy. Enjoy your day.",Capricorn
"Jun 13, 2022 - The astral energy will have you reminiscing all day long over childhood memories, Capricorn. These memories will take you to the houses and places where you were raised and where your personality and character were formed. Many memories will surface - happy, melancholy, and everything in between. You should probably seize this opportunity to write them down.",Capricorn
"Jun 14, 2022 - Today you'll question yourself about your private life, Capricorn. Indeed, you have to change your behavior. You're used to making decisions just for yourself. Now you'll realize that you need to think not only about yourself but also about your partner. This phase in your relationship is difficult and will lead to drastic measures. You now have to assume your responsibilities.",Capricorn
"Jun 15, 2022 - Communication, particularly with family members and romantic partners, could take place more subtly than verbally today. Nonetheless, Capricorn, you'll sense strong love and support from everyone. Romance, especially, should be intense and sensual, so this is a great day to schedule an evening alone with a lover if possible. Inspiration for creative projects, particularly in the home, could well up from deep inside. Don't suppress it - let it flow.",Capricorn
"Jun 16, 2022 - Today is likely to be a gratifying day, Capricorn, but perhaps more serious than you'd planned. A longtime friend might call and want to talk. This person or another might want to discuss a possible business enterprise that's apt to be worthy of consideration. Everyone around you might seem egocentric, and you could feel that your concerns are of no interest to anyone. Don't let that upset you.",Capricorn
"Jun 17, 2022 - If you analyze your life, you'll see that it has completely changed over the past twelve months, Capricorn. You've matured as an individual and your actions have been beneficial to yourself and those around you. Try to make changes as often as you can. Don't stop now. You need to feel that your life is evolving all the time. There is no time to rest.",Capricorn
"Jun 18, 2022 - It's always like this at first with you, Capricorn. You know something is happening but have no idea what. It's as if electricity flows through you. You're practically vibrating with emotion. You can feel other people's emotions, too. Begin by listening to your heart and feeling the sensation in your body. Only then will you be able to judge the intensity of your feelings. Could this be desire - or love?",Capricorn
"Jun 19, 2022 - You're the type of person who loves knowing a lot of different people, Capricorn. You feel that you must help your friends communicate so that they have a better forum in which to express themselves. You're good at bringing out the best in others and helping them find a solid footing in the present, despite your love of the past. Go with the flow.",Capricorn
"Jun 20, 2022 - Today you might spend a lot of time running errands, Capricorn. You could run into friends or neighbors, but you probably won't feel like stopping to talk with them. You're apt to be working on something important that you'll want to get back to as soon as possible. Traffic or other delays could get in your way, however. Don't make yourself crazy. Go with the flow and you'll accomplish what you want.",Capricorn
"Jun 21, 2022 - You might be getting a bit forceful with your emotions today, Capricorn. Don't be surprised if you're like a fire-breathing dragon when you speak. Sparks are apt to fly. Strong feelings have been building up inside you. Now is the time to release them in all their intensity. People need to hear the things you have to say. You're doing yourself and others a disservice by keeping it all bottled up inside.",Capricorn
"Jun 22, 2022 - Anything having to do with love and romance is likely to go well today if you play your cards right, Capricorn. See what you can do to ground your fluctuating emotions. Try your best to bring them into balance. Take a practical approach and slow down. Communicating with groups of people will be extremely rewarding. Come out of your shell and show your sensitive side to the world. It will be greatly appreciated.",Capricorn
"Jun 23, 2022 - You may feel as if someone is poking you today, Capricorn, urging you to get up and get moving. Don't be surprised if someone seems to be picking on you for no reason. Other people's lack of sympathy and sensitivity could be acute on a day like this. Try not to take it personally. Your hard outer shell may be put to the test in terms of its ability to protect your soft vulnerability.",Capricorn
"Jun 24, 2022 - Many of your personal goals have either been met or are in the process of manifesting, Capricorn. This has you feeling exhilarated. However, others around you might have their hands out. You might be asked to contribute to charities or make personal loans to people you don't really know. You tend to want to be of assistance wherever you can but be discriminating about helping others right now. Some people may be less than trustworthy.",Capricorn
"Jun 25, 2022 - A depressed friend may need cheering up. Your ability to nurture and listen sympathetically will prove beneficial, Capricorn. Take care not to absorb any of this person's dejection. Your own life should continue to go well, with business and career successes leading to new friendships and goals. Hang onto your own enthusiasm and optimism while extending a compassionate ear to others.",Capricorn
"Jun 26, 2022 - You're likely to want to be left alone with your own thoughts today. Relaxing with a good book might be at the top of your agenda, Capricorn, and you aren't liable to want to be interrupted. Noise and requests that don't usually bother you might tick you off, so it's best to try to spend some time alone. Also try to be your usual considerate self. To release tension, take a walk.",Capricorn
"Jun 27, 2022 - Today is a great day to work on getting yourself together. Your emotions are stable, leaving your heart free to soar in the clouds. Feel free to daydream. Now is a good time to make plans with a romantic partner if possible. Solidify your relationship and confirm your commitment to each other. If you're single, now is a good time to set a plan in motion that will bring you closer to your greatest fantasy.",Capricorn
"Jun 28, 2022 - The opportunity to increase your income could spur you to channel more energy and inspiration into career and business matters, Capricorn. Some vivid, intense dreams might reveal a lot about you and your motivations, which could increase your self-awareness and make everything easier for you. The drive to succeed in material and spiritual matters is likely to play a powerful role in everything you do today. Onward and upward!",Capricorn
"Jun 29, 2022 - Your emotions may seem a bit muddy today and you might not understand the reason why, Capricorn. Share your thoughts with others, and you should find that talking it out will help you sort through the maelstrom of feelings. If you need to, shift things down to second gear for a little more power. Take your time. Don't let others rush you into believing something that you know isn't true.",Capricorn
"Jun 30, 2022 - Key into your sensual, beautiful nature, Capricorn. Take time each day to attend to your soul and make sure it's getting the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people could pop up out of nowhere, so don't be surprised if a former lover texts or calls. Things from the past may be coming back to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2023 - No matter what friends tell you, Capricorn, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn
"Jul 1, 2022 - Little voices are whispering in your ear today, Capricorn. They could be asking you to join them in the clouds. You might get the feeling that there's a lot of tension between what your heart has to say and what your mind has to say. Don't be surprised if the energy of the day leaves you confused by the time the day ends. Don't stress about making hard decisions or commitments.",Capricorn
"Jul 2, 2022 - Take a break from the seriousness that has prevailed over the past couple days, Capricorn. You'll find that upbeat conversations are the way to navigate through today's waters. You might notice that communication is more active and that words are especially effective. Talk and people will listen. Listen and people will talk. The exchange of ideas is critical on a day like this.",Capricorn
"Jul 3, 2022 - Your heart may experience some wild fluctuations today, Capricorn. It may seem as if your emotions are on a runaway train with no track. If so, the best thing to do is sit by yourself and write. Compose a letter, song, or journal entry. You'll find that you're much less confused than you thought. When in doubt, consult someone you love and trust. Go with your instincts.",Capricorn
"Jul 4, 2022 - The subtle tension in the air today might be just what you need to make you more aware of subconscious issues that affect your behavior, Capricorn. You'll find that you need to get a lot off your chest. The more honest you can be about the pain people have caused you, the more loving words will be able to flow in the future. Open the channels of communication and let it flow.",Capricorn
"Jul 5, 2022 - Today is an excellent day for you, one in which you'll find a great deal of strength in your emotions, Capricorn. Trust that your instincts are serving you well. You have nothing to lose by following your heart. This is an important time for you to rekindle the dreams that you've let smolder. Bring more of your fantasy world into your everyday life.",Capricorn
"Jul 6, 2022 - You might find yourself sidestepping in order to avoid a commitment today, Capricorn. Don't keep giving someone the runaround. Be strong and let people know your thoughts even if you think their feelings will be hurt. Your job is to protect your emotions. Other people can handle their own. Be aggressive if you have to be. Your own sanity depends on you being true to yourself.",Capricorn
"Jul 7, 2022 - It could be hard for you to get a handle on things today, Capricorn, as your focus seems to jump from one subject to the next without finding resolution for any. This isn't a day to find solutions. You're better off researching, asking questions, and gathering facts. Keep the channels of communication open, and don't try to pin anyone down for a solid answer. You'll accomplish a great deal by keeping things active and light.",Capricorn
"Jul 8, 2022 - Maintain your psychic shield today, Capricorn, because you'll need it. People's comments may seem harsh even if they mean well. Your best defense against the critical tone of the day is to use other people's criticisms as constructively as you can in order to build a stronger foundation from which to work. Process this energy in a positive frame of mind and use it to get things done.",Capricorn
"Jul 9, 2022 - People are going to appreciate extra attention from you today, Capricorn, so feel free to give it out like candy to everyone you come in contact with. A kind gesture and warm word won't be forgotten. Let your generous and kind spirit shine through. Open your heart extra wide and spread love to the world. It's the perfect day to love and laugh.",Capricorn
"Jul 10, 2022 - You might look around your house and think of some new and exciting ways to spruce it up a little, Capricorn. Perhaps some new paint, wallpaper, or carpet, or even a small art object could make a big difference. You may want to try it. A romantic partner could spend a lot of time working on this with you and it might well bring you closer together. Have fun!",Capricorn
"Jul 11, 2022 - You have the sensitivity to pick up on what's going on in every situation today, Capricorn. What you're apt to find are powerful emotions coming into conflict with extremely strong opinions. Welcome to the battle between the head and the heart. On this day you may be more apt to side with the heart. Realize that this arena is quite heated and that the forces at work are extremely stubborn.",Capricorn
"Jul 12, 2022 - Interaction with others may not be especially satisfying for you today, Capricorn. You could get the feeling that other people don't really care as much as you thought they did. Keep in mind that everyone is doing the best they can. Most people aren't as sensitive as you. They probably have no idea what sort of impact their words have on you. Give others the benefit of the doubt.",Capricorn
"Jul 13, 2022 - You may spend much of your day trying to sort out financial matters for yourself, your job, or perhaps for a friend or relative, Capricorn. A lot of phone calls, and a lot of research, perhaps on the Internet, could be necessary in order to accomplish this. Whatever you decide to do, you'll attack it with determination and feel a great deal of satisfaction when you're done. Go to it!",Capricorn
"Jul 14, 2022 - You could wake up this morning, look around, and decide you want to spend as much time as possible working on your home, Capricorn. You could be bored with the decor and want to make some changes. Spend the day coming up with ideas and then tonight try to analyze the situation and see what's feasible now. Most likely you'll be able to do some but not all of what you want.",Capricorn
"Jul 15, 2022 - Today should bring pleasant and profitable communications with women, possibly some new friends. A lot of people will want talk to you, although perhaps more than you can realistically handle. Be careful not to commit to too many things. You could end up spreading yourself too thin. Travel to faraway lands may seem tempting at this time, Capricorn, but that might not be possible for some time. Relax and enjoy the company for now.",Capricorn
"Jul 16, 2022 - Today won't be like most other days, Capricorn. Look around and you'll see that people either have their heads in the clouds, are depressed, or seem to be trying to keep up a good front. The planetary atmosphere is such that a lot of people - and you in particular - feel frustrated by an inability to realize their dreams. This is a difficult situation to be sure. Know that it will pass.",Capricorn
"Jul 17, 2022 - The current aspects encourage cultivating your spirituality, Capricorn. However advanced you are on your spiritual journey, there are revelations, awakenings, and new experiences waiting. Visit a church or a secluded spot in nature that speaks to you and soak up the energy. Indulge in some investigation. Check out some books on spirituality and symbols, and pay attention to your dreams.",Capricorn
"Jul 18, 2022 - At some point during the day you might find yourself involved in a project that piques your interest far more than usual. You could throw yourself more deeply into it than is necessary now. Take care that it doesn't distract you from what needs to be done, Capricorn. Your wisdom is especially sharp, and you can use your intuition to gain valuable practical knowledge. Spend the evening meditating.",Capricorn
"Jul 19, 2022 - The love and romance department should be going pretty well for you now, Capricorn. This is the time to probe more deeply into your current affair with that person who catches your eye. There's a greater sensitivity to your emotions today, and you could find yourself holding back a bit more than usual. An air of mystery and intrigue will surround you, drawing others toward you like a moth to a candle.",Capricorn
"Jul 20, 2022 - Business and financial matters look promising today, Capricorn, but you could find yourself torn between the need to attend to these matters and the desire to relax at home. If you have to make a choice, it might be best to choose the former, because today's aspects promise opportunities that might not come around again for a while. The evening should be your own. Plan an intimate dinner with a lover. You'll like the results!",Capricorn
"Jul 21, 2022 - Concentrate on nurturing your needs right now instead of trying to accommodate the needs of others, Capricorn. There is a difficult tension that arises when you try to comfort someone who really doesn't want to be comforted. The best way to handle the situation is to leave the person alone and tend to your own emotions. If you're more stable and clear, you'll be better able to help others. Take this time to recharge your own batteries.",Capricorn
"Jul 22, 2022 - You may feel smothered by certain individuals and loved ones who hang on you like barnacles on a rock, Capricorn. You're a big part of their emotional support system and they rely on you for strength. Today, however, you could get frustrated by this extra weight. You'll more than likely want to rip those barnacles off in order to give you more breathing room. Freedom from others' emotional baggage is the key for today.",Capricorn
"Jul 23, 2022 - Today is an excellent day in which you should be able to ground your emotions and find a greater amount of stability in your life. As you walk down the street, be conscious of the Earth below you. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and realize that you're a living part and product of this great planet. Don't separate yourself from Mother Nature - you are her child. Respect her.",Capricorn
"Jul 24, 2022 - Other people may try to wield their power even when it isn't their place. This is one time when people may try to show off their IQ by offering random facts that don't offer anything useful to the situation at hand but just serve to prove their knowledge of esoteric trivia. Try not to buy into other people's displays of power, Capricorn. There's more than likely a great deal of hype and not much substance.",Capricorn
"Jul 25, 2022 - Someone may challenge your mental capabilities today, Capricorn. Your natural tendency might be to take the information, mull it over for a while, and come back with your decision or opinion at some later date. The truth of the matter is that things are moving quickly and decisions must be made quickly and efficiently. Stay on your toes and have confidence in your mental processes.",Capricorn
"Jul 26, 2022 - Today is one of those days in which if you want love, you need to go out and get it, Capricorn. Don't waste your time sitting at home and sulking. Be adventuresome and take that first step. You're the only one who has the ability to pull yourself out of the rut, so do it. There is a great deal of passion behind your romantic intentions at this time, Cupid, so be careful where you point your arrow.",Capricorn
"Jul 27, 2022 - There are extremely slow-moving, subtle energies coming into play today that may not be so easily felt, Capricorn. What they provide is a key to manifesting your wildest dreams. Fantasy can become your reality, but it may only come one small, subtle step at a time. Don't give up. Focus on the unconventional way to get things done. You'll eventually achieve everything your heart desires as long as you truly believe you can.",Capricorn
"Jul 28, 2022 - Your mental clarity is astounding today, Capricorn. You'll find that your pattern of thinking reflects exactly who you are at the core of your being. The moment you walk out the door this morning, you'll find that your brain wants to process everything. This action will give you greater assuredness and insight, making this a terrific day to stand up and speak your mind.",Capricorn
"Jul 29, 2022 - You should always leave a loved one with loving words, Capricorn. Each time you exit a room, consider that you're never going to enter that room again. Perhaps you'll never see those people again. Make sure you take care of the people you like. People might need extra attention today to feel appreciated and important to you. Cuddle up to the people who mean the most to you.",Capricorn
"Jul 30, 2022 - This is the beginning of an exciting period in your love life, Capricorn. Your relationship with a significant other may have been in a rut lately, but that's about to change. Both of you are ready for something big. Perhaps a move is in store or you could both decide commit to one another more permanently. Follow your instincts, because they'll lead you where you're meant to go.",Capricorn
"Jul 31, 2022 - Separate the wheat from the chaff today. Look at your relationships and decide who your true friends are. You're loyal, which is to your credit, but why be loyal to people who don't return it? You've given these so-called friends plenty of chances to demonstrate their affection. It's time to let them fall by the wayside and free up time to spend with your real friends.",Capricorn
"Aug 1, 2022 - Your mind is clear and your sensitivity focused, Capricorn. Now is a good time to make a move. Don't let insecurity or fear keep you from pursuing your dreams. Realize that action you take today doesn't need to be a bold outward movement in order to be effective. In truth, quite the contrary is true. You can accomplish a great deal by turning thought and energy inward.",Capricorn
"Aug 2, 2022 - Love and romance are coming your way today, but it's important to be practical, Capricorn. Don't take your relationships for granted. Realize that love doesn't necessarily mean that everything is perfect. Structure and discipline are often required in order to maintain a healthy partnership. You should be able to incorporate these elements rather well, so make the most of this energy.",Capricorn
"Aug 3, 2022 - The wind is blowing quite strongly today, and you'll find that things are flying around in a frenzy, Capricorn. This whirlwind of activity is threatening to pick you up, spin you around, and take you away. Be cautious of anything that suggests this. People may take on unrealistic attitudes that lure you into grand schemes. Beware of fanciful promises.",Capricorn
"Aug 4, 2022 - A friend or colleague involved in an enterprise with you could be inhibited in some way by lack of money, Capricorn. This might involve some unexpected adjustment on your part, perhaps finding someone else to temporarily fill in. It's a pain, but you and your colleagues will manage, and your friend should have it together in time. Find a way to work around the situation. Hang in there.",Capricorn
"Aug 5, 2022 - Your psychic sense is apt to be keen as you fill your mind with fanciful scenarios, Capricorn. These pictures in your head aren't as farfetched as you might think. Today would be a good day to listen to your inner guidance - the aspect of yourself that's keyed into hearing subtle important messages. Not everyone can pick up on them.",Capricorn
"Aug 6, 2022 - Sometimes your emotions overtake your rational thoughts, Capricorn, and you end up acting on impulse. Today you'll find that your head and heart are aligned on significant issues, and that they're working well together. Try not to swing the other way by becoming too rational. Your goal is to find the best working balance.",Capricorn
"Aug 7, 2022 - Some bizarre and rather silly dreams might come to you tonight, Capricorn. They may be the sort that is so crazy that you actually wake up laughing. Don't dismiss them. Silly or not, these dreams are trying to tell you something. Write them down the way you would any other vivid dream and analyze the symbols in the same way - even if they cause a few giggles.",Capricorn
"Aug 8, 2022 - A conflict between career and home obligations could arise today, Capricorn. You may feel powerless, so it could make you feel irritable. Try to think clearly and find a solution for your conundrum, then act on it. Avoid the temptation to quarrel with others. Go for a good workout in the evening. Whether dancing or jogging, just work off some of that frustration.",Capricorn
"Aug 9, 2022 - Nervous tension could cause a temporary malaise that keeps your energy very low today. But there are tasks that need to be done, Capricorn, so you'll probably try to do them in spite of the way you feel. Try not to overwork yourself or take your weariness out on others. It's better to let some things go than make yourself and everyone else that much more stressed out.",Capricorn
"Aug 10, 2022 - Happy events involving a close female relative might have you feeling emotional, Capricorn. A marriage or birth could be involved. Your projects, particularly those with other people, could proceed well despite difficulties you've had to overcome. The results could move you to tears. You may feel the need to control yourself, but don't be afraid to show how you feel.",Capricorn
"Aug 11, 2022 - Dreams and meditations could lead to insights about how best to handle your finances, Capricorn. Your intuition is very strong. Also, you could receive some surprising ideas from media sources. No matter how outrageous an idea seems, consider it well before deciding. A written plan of action for anything you do would be helpful. You'll want to keep track of all your ideas.",Capricorn
"Aug 12, 2022 - Have you been pursuing a career involving the creative arts, Capricorn? If so, news of an upcoming success could come your way today. This is a gratifying day for you. Friends could phone or come by to congratulate you. Ideas for new projects could fill your head. Go out to dinner tonight with friends or your romantic partner, if possible. You deserve it!",Capricorn
"Aug 13, 2022 - Activities of some kind could put you in the public eye today, Capricorn. Some work you've done well might bring you richly deserved acknowledgement. Your energy and enthusiasm are already high, and you're probably all fired up to do more. This could bring up thoughts of changes in your working situation. But don't give notice right away. Some careful thought is needed.",Capricorn
"Aug 14, 2022 - It could be scary for you to do anything risky for fear of conflict or failure, Capricorn. Perhaps you've tried to become invisible in different situations so you can avoid being noticed. These defense mechanisms may serve you for a while but acting out of fear or guilt won't get you where you need to go. To achieve what you want, you must act with confidence, love, and faith.",Capricorn
"Aug 15, 2022 - Try not to let the blues get you down, Capricorn. While it's true some days can seem to drag, the busier you stay, the faster time will pass. Get down to finishing any work still pending and make plans for an evening out. If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, not only will things seem to speed up, but you'll also feel better knowing you're almost done.",Capricorn
"Aug 16, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you feel super today, Capricorn. Chances are good that you'll enjoy renewed physical strength, with energy to spare. It might be a good day to tackle any projects that require muscle. Perhaps there are household repairs that need tackling or furniture to move. You might want to go to the gym. Whatever the activity, this is a good day to go for it with gusto.",Capricorn
"Aug 17, 2022 - You might feel cornered into doing something you don't want to do today, Capricorn. Perhaps you made a promise to handle a project. Maybe someone decides it's the day to call in an I.O.U. Either way, say so if you aren't comfortable following through. Today's energy enhances your ability to express yourself and be understood. Rescheduling may be far better than potential resentment.",Capricorn
"Aug 18, 2022 - You may feel a need to get moving today, Capricorn. Almost everyone at times prefers quiet activities, books, art, and even just sitting around to physical activity. But your health can suffer if you're too inactive. Fresh air, exercise, and sunshine are vital to your well-being. Don't resist the urge to get up and do something active. Chances are good that you'll really enjoy it.",Capricorn
"Aug 19, 2022 - Find new ways to expand your horizons, Capricorn. The web has an infinite number of resources and information to explore. Not only that, but your community and local colleges offer various online courses to choose from. Think about what you'd enjoy learning - perhaps a new job skill or craft. Whether it's judo or Italian or woodworking that strikes your fancy, it's out there. Find it.",Capricorn
"Aug 20, 2022 - Expect an added boost of physical energy today, Capricorn. It's an excellent day to clean out closets. Exercise like yoga or walking will be most enjoyable. It could also prove to be well worth your while to look at your goals. Are you where you want to be at this stage of your life or are there changes that need to be made? Give your brain and body a good workout.",Capricorn
"Aug 21, 2022 - Don't dwell on your fluctuating moods today, Capricorn. Look at the larger trends and how positive elements are coming together in your favor. Stay optimistic and remember that you were put here for a reason. Respect and honor your values by staying in tune with yourself and the world around you. There's a profound power in your stillness, so cherish all moments of silence.",Capricorn
"Aug 22, 2022 - Your emotions could be extra powerful today, Capricorn, although something may not feel as if it's sitting right. It could be a feeling of manipulation. Perhaps you've misjudged someone else's sensitivity and now they're working to get back at you in a subtle yet harmful way. Attend to your feelings and spend time alone if it helps you get more in tune with your emotions.",Capricorn
"Aug 23, 2022 - Inspiration is the word for today, Capricorn. Your creative talent should blossom and motivate you to work on wonderful ideas. This could involve music, painting, decorating, or cooking. Relax and have fun with it. Whatever you do, you'll probably be pleased with the results. Feedback from others should be encouraging. Make notes of ideas you don't use today to remember them later.",Capricorn
"Aug 24, 2022 - A powerful need to reach someone either for business or personal reasons could have you spending a lot of time on the phone that may come to nothing, Capricorn. You might call every place this person could possibly be, and this could prove frustrating. Your friend may be away. Leave a message or two and let him or her call you back. Find something else to distract you.",Capricorn
"Aug 25, 2022 - There's apt to be powerful aggression today that may leave you feeling like you want to declare war on everyone, Capricorn. You may get the feeling that everyone else is completely nuts and you're the only one who really knows what's going on. Beware of misinformed people and false information. Fights could erupt over facts that seem true at first but are just someone's misguided dreams.",Capricorn
"Aug 26, 2022 - Things will be extremely light and airy today, Capricorn. You may find that people are a bit less sensitive than you. Moving out of your comfort zone is the key to growth. Don't hesitate to move into the unknown. You can achieve a greater sense of balance between yourself and your environment if you're open to change and accept it.",Capricorn
"Aug 27, 2022 - Today you wake up feeling reinvigorated and renewed, Capricorn. You feel as though you can accomplish anything. And very likely, today you can. Anything you set your mind and attention to works out beautifully. Take care that you don't gloat too much, though. Just because you feel invincible doesn't necessarily mean that you are.",Capricorn
"Aug 28, 2022 - Today your creative impulses could seem blocked, Capricorn. You might be trying to reach your own or someone else's deadline. You may feel the need to get some work done, while your muse seems to have gone on vacation. If your deadline is official, phone whoever's in charge and ask for an extension. You won't be happy with the results if you force yourself to work today.",Capricorn
"Aug 29, 2022 - Are you getting along better than ever with a significant other, Capricorn? If so, it's probably because you're more attuned to what your partner thinks, feels, needs, and wants. You might fetch something before he or she even knows it's necessary. This can help you reach a new understanding of your beloved. Go with the flow and make the most of it. You'll be glad you did.",Capricorn
"Aug 30, 2022 - You should be in a good mood today, Capricorn, but don't be surprised if some aggravating force steps on your toes or pulls your chain in some way. More than likely, there isn't much you can do about the situation except grin and bear it. Do your best to maintain your position and don't lose self-confidence just because someone else isn't in tune with how you handle your affairs.",Capricorn
"Aug 31, 2022 - This could be a particularly stressful day, Capricorn. Your workload is heavier than ever, thanks to the increased responsibility you've taken on. The day seems endless, yet there aren't enough hours to get done all that needs doing. Take care not to take your anxiety out on others. If you're nice to them, they may even help you finish your project!",Capricorn
"Sep 1, 2022 - There may be a damper on your mood today, Capricorn, especially in the morning. It could seem as if everyone is having fun but you. Having a good time is more a state of mind than anything else. Try not to get trapped in a lousy mindset. Late afternoon is a good time to ground your emotions. Operate from a point of stability instead of jealousy.",Capricorn
"Sep 2, 2022 - Don't expect to spend a lot of time at home today, Capricorn. You're more likely to be in the car and away from home. There may be errands and other obligations to fulfill. Try to pace yourself in whatever you do or else you might be exhausted by day's end. Take the time to stop and enjoy yourself. This will ensure a fun rather than tiring day.",Capricorn
"Sep 3, 2022 - Unusual experiences may give rise to a new interest in the sciences or occult practices like magic or alchemy. This is an excellent time to start perusing such subjects, Capricorn, or embark on a formal study of astrology. A lucky money break could come your way today. It might be a gift or a repaid loan. Your inclination might be to go out and spend it all. Take care!",Capricorn
"Sep 4, 2022 - Seek the counsel of someone older and wiser today, Capricorn. Whether you want to or not, you may encounter someone with authority who's likely to tell you what he or she thinks. Heed the advice that comes from others. There is a whole other perspective out there that you need to consider in order to bring things back to equilibrium.",Capricorn
"Sep 5, 2022 - You're intuitive by nature, Capricorn, and today you could almost be clairvoyant. Obey your instincts today. Don't let your rational mind get in the way. This isn't the day to be logical! You can sense the needs of others, so you could earn some gratitude by giving them what they need without being asked. Romantic relationships should be warm, loving, and intimate.",Capricorn
"Sep 6, 2022 - You could have some intense dreams tonight, Capricorn. You might find that they bring inspiration for creative projects, perhaps for redecorating or otherwise beautifying your home. You could feel energetic now and want to charge ahead and work on your project until you drop. Take care to pace yourself. You might tire to the point of feeling ill.",Capricorn
"Sep 7, 2022 - A lover or close friend may seem to have dropped out of the picture, and this could have you worried, confused, and wondering if this person isn't interested in continuing a relationship with you. Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. The person has his or her troubles and will eventually want a strong, sympathetic shoulder to cry on. You're likely to be that person!",Capricorn
"Sep 8, 2022 - Don't expect a great deal of sensitivity from others when it comes to issues concerning love and beauty today, Capricorn. People are apt to be in their own little worlds. It may be hard for you to relate to them now. Trying to sway others to your point of view could be possible, but it may be quite difficult and, more importantly, not worth the effort.",Capricorn
"Sep 9, 2022 - There might be a lot of work to do at home today. Since certain family members are conveniently absent, you may feel that the burden falls on you. Don't be a martyr, however. Just do what you can and leave the rest. Uncertainties about money could also be on your mind but put these aside for now. You'll be better able to deal with them tomorrow.",Capricorn
"Sep 10, 2022 - Romance is in the air today, Capricorn. It's likely that your relationship with your loved ones will see a dramatic improvement. Perhaps some flowers will arrive unexpectedly, or you'll be paid a sincere compliment. Harmony reigns in the work environment as well. Both people and machines run smoothly and efficiently.",Capricorn
"Sep 11, 2022 - Some vivid and wonderful dreams might provide inspiration for future creative projects. You're feeling cheerful and optimistic now, and your enthusiasm is likely to continue. Success in career and relationships is indicated. Your increased intuition heightens your understanding of others. Don't be surprised if friends and colleagues line up for your support and guidance.",Capricorn
"Sep 12, 2022 - A close friend or loved one might drop out of sight today. You may panic when he or she doesn't return your phone calls. Don't jump to conclusions. They're preoccupied with matters that for the moment appear important and will contact you in time. When you do finally connect, you could hear some interesting news. Relax, go about your business, and look forward to the call.",Capricorn
"Sep 13, 2022 - A lot of changes could be taking place in your life now, Capricorn. Even though most of them are positive, the upheaval can be unsettling right now. Don't give in to panic. Nothing needs to be done that you can't handle. Take each task one step at a time. As you vault each hurdle, the road ahead seems that much smoother. When you arrive, all will be well. Keep going!",Capricorn
"Sep 14, 2022 - You may get the feeling that you're operating in an emotional crossfire today, Capricorn. On the one hand, you may have a ""me first,"" selfish feeling that demands attention from others. You may also sense the need to work to serve others and bring like-minded people together. Realize that both of these energies are valid and deserve your attention. Balance is the key. Work to soothe your fluctuating emotions.",Capricorn
"Sep 15, 2022 - Your intuition is extra keen today, Capricorn, and your mental aim is on target. Other people may sink into the swamp, but you're the life raft they can cling to. Your amazing mental clarity will be invaluable throughout the day. You'll be able to communicate your feelings clearly, and you should find their receptivity to your thoughts much greater than usual.",Capricorn
"Sep 16, 2022 - A message or phone call from someone dear who lives far away could arrive today. You've been thinking about this person for a while, Capricorn, so don't be surprised if you hear from him or her. You're especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of others right now. In fact, you may feel especially inspired to work on projects of your own, as ideas are likely to fill your head. Have fun!",Capricorn
"Sep 17, 2022 - Today you may be asked to speak to a virtual gathering or lead an online discussion group, Capricorn. You tend to be shy, but today you'll be all for it and enjoy being in the limelight, albeit temporarily. You'll certainly shine, and others may pay you sincere compliments. After the event, enjoy the rest of your day. You earned it.",Capricorn
"Sep 18, 2022 - Professional difficulties could be resolved by outside assistance, Capricorn. Equipment may have gone haywire, or miscommunications could have led to snarls. Perhaps you need to call in a consultant. It's possible that you might come up with the right solution at the right time and earn some well-deserved respect. Whatever the difficulty, it won't last.",Capricorn
"Sep 19, 2022 - Action is the word of the day. Whether you're initiating it or feeling the brunt of it, you'll be caught up in the vortex of it. Try not to lose your tempter today, Capricorn, and don't be surprised if people act rashly and insensitively. Perhaps this is their way of saying they need you and that your energy and input are important. Have confidence in your words.",Capricorn
"Sep 20, 2022 - Have you been feeling less than your normal self, Capricorn? If so, today you may suddenly regain your strength and be raring to go. You might even be tempted to start a rigorous exercise program. Go ahead and start, but pace yourself and try not to make up for lost time all at once. You need to ease into these things. Maybe start with walking and yoga.",Capricorn
"Sep 21, 2022 - You may feel a bit restless and unsettled without really knowing why, Capricorn. Stresses on the job could churn up repressed resentment from the past that you need to release. Try to discern exactly what these stresses remind you of. If you're unable to do this, however, you'll probably still reap the benefits of the release. Stay focused on your work and just let it happen.",Capricorn
"Sep 22, 2022 - This is a good time to forge new relationships, Capricorn. Be open-minded if someone you know approaches with a proposal. Do your homework and examine the potential risks, but this is a fine period in which to pursue something new. Success and good fortune are coming. Keep your eyes and ears open for opportunities. You may hear some important news from your love interest.",Capricorn
"Sep 23, 2022 - Today you could run into an old friend and suddenly see him or her in a different light. A romantic, sensual attraction you never believed possible could suddenly seem overwhelming. Try to gauge if this person feels the same way. If so, plan a date. Don't write this possibility off because you've labeled this person a ""friend.""",Capricorn
"Sep 24, 2022 - If you're currently romantically involved, Capricorn, your lover could well go from what appears to be utter lassitude to total passion. This could throw you for a loop, and you might not know exactly how to deal with it. If you're single, you could meet someone you find attractive but forget to get his or her contact information! Keep paper and pen handy. You don't want to miss anything!",Capricorn
"Sep 25, 2022 - Your intuition is working overtime today, Capricorn, making you sensitive to others' deepest emotions. It may be that the celestial atmosphere has everyone feeling open and honest, eager to grow into his or her most authentic self. Certainly, that's how you feel. Take some time out of your busy schedule to reflect on your regrets and successes. Be as true to yourself as possible.",Capricorn
"Sep 26, 2022 - Too much hard work and stress could be taking a physical toll on you today, Capricorn. But it isn't likely to stop you from working intently and energetically on a project that fascinates you. This enterprise could be personal or job related, but whatever it is, the turn it takes is apt to surprise you. It might not be anything like what you'd planned! Go to it!",Capricorn
"Sep 27, 2022 - This could be a quiet day for you and your partner, Capricorn. You could spend some time reflecting on past achievements and future goals. It's important to get a clear picture about the past so you can draw conclusions and make workable plans. If you have a family, you'll probably be interested in activities that everyone will enjoy. Make some time to get together when it’s possible. Leave tension behind.",Capricorn
"Sep 28, 2022 - You and other members of your household might suddenly decide to do one more thorough house cleaning, Capricorn. Usually this would be a good idea, but today it doesn't really need it, and you might work too hard and do too much. Do you really need to clean your closets now? Dust and vacuum, then spruce it up with some decorations, and that should be enough for now. Relax!",Capricorn
"Sep 29, 2022 - It's possible that a big change is in store for you in the near future, Capricorn. It may be that you've come to realize that your current home and neighborhood are no longer a good fit. If you've been toying with the idea of moving, today you may get some news that motivates you to make your fantasy a reality. This is a good day to peruse the real estate listings. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.",Capricorn
"Sep 30, 2022 - Life's been a real whirlwind lately, Capricorn. You may feel a bit overwhelmed by everything that’s been going on. It's fun to catch up with everyone, but a bit daunting to renew ties with old friends and try to remember things that are going on with new ones. Take a deep breath, Capricorn, you're doing just fine.",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2023 - No matter what friends tell you, Capricorn, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn
"Oct 1, 2022 - If you own your home or have any kind of investments in real estate, Capricorn, you might hear some great news today about the value of that investment. It's likely to be increasing, and probably will continue in that direction. This could make a big difference in your life in some way right now. In fact, there might be a number of options opening to you. Consider them all carefully and go for the gold.",Capricorn
"Oct 2, 2022 - It could be that you feel a bit of pressure today to start or create something that you aren't quite ready for, Capricorn. There is hesitation on your part that indicates you should take it slowly and learn more of the facts before you jump into the fray. Position yourself in such a way that you take control of the situation rather than become a victim of it.",Capricorn
"Oct 3, 2022 - There's apt to be a comfortable feeling about today that should make you feel quite secure and nurtured, Capricorn. Perhaps you're feeling protected by a strong force, maybe an internal one, that's reminding you that as long as you stay within the lines, everything will be fine. There's a familiarity to things that will make it easy for you to navigate any rough waters.",Capricorn
"Oct 4, 2022 - You're apt to get the feeling that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence today, Capricorn. Try not to get too hung up on this. Either make the effort to go where the landscape looks richer and more fruitful or stay where you are. The key to true happiness is to make sure that regardless of where you end up, you enjoy the spot where you are.",Capricorn
"Oct 5, 2022 - Warm and sensitive by nature, Capricorn, today you could feel especially sensual. Sex and romance are likely to be on your mind. Romantic novels and movies may seem especially appealing now, as could cozy beds and warm baths. Plan a romantic evening with the special person in your life, if possible. Perhaps a special candlelit dinner at home.",Capricorn
"Oct 6, 2022 - While you normally like all of your romantic relationships to be extremely nurturing and comforting, you may find that this isn't always possible, Capricorn. There's a disconnect between you and a close partner right now that could be hard to rectify. Time is really the only thing that's likely to resolve this sort of problem. Remember that all of your relationships can't always go exactly according to plan.",Capricorn
"Oct 7, 2022 - Romantic relationships may not exactly be going as well as you'd like, Capricorn, but don't get discouraged. Hang in there and you will find that things eventually come around your way. You may need to strengthen your internal sense of confidence, since it's doubtful that you will get much support from interactions with the people around you.",Capricorn
"Oct 8, 2022 - You're likely to gravitate toward those who can put on a show and carry your imagination to a far-off land today, Capricorn. Look for this quality in others instead of turning to the TV to satisfy this need. If you aren't careful, you may end up a couch potato all day, without talking to anyone. Take note that real life is much more enriching that anything that could come over the airwaves.",Capricorn
"Oct 9, 2022 - Your mood should be quite good for the most part, Capricorn, but there's apt to be some tension in your relationships. Romantic endeavors aren't exactly in your favor now, so don't force an issue that seems too difficult to resolve. Find comfort in your internal warmth. By taking the time to nurture yourself, you will inevitably have more love to give to the people around you.",Capricorn
"Oct 10, 2022 - Worries about money that may have preoccupied you for the past day or so could prove unfounded, Capricorn. This should come as a real relief to you, although it may be difficult to grasp at first. Your mind is still getting in the way of accepting it. Go over your correspondence and bank records as many times as you want. The answer should be the same - all is better than you thought.",Capricorn
"Oct 11, 2022 - You generally tend to be sensitive and intuitive, Capricorn, but today you might be even more so. Reading about people from other places and times might cause you to tune into their thoughts and feelings and receive new insight into human nature. Creative projects, particularly writing, benefit from this. If you want to remember what you come up with, write it down.",Capricorn
"Oct 12, 2022 - A goal that you've been working on could finally be reached, Capricorn. A group of friends you might not have seen for a long time could schedule a small get-together that you will be all too glad to attend, if possible. Expect to have a lot of fun exchanging news and ideas with these people. You will probably feel particularly happy to see them. You won't want to let so much time go by before you reconnect again.",Capricorn
"Oct 13, 2022 - Your natural warmth is enhanced by a new sense of self-confidence, Capricorn. Whichever kind of group activities and social events are possible might bring you into touch with people who prove to be valuable business contacts. Whatever goals you've attempted to reach may finally show signs of materializing, possibly through the efforts of others who believe in you. This should be a very fortunate and enjoyable day for you. Make the most of it!",Capricorn
"Oct 14, 2022 - You're finally on the mend, Capricorn. The minor ailments that may have dragged you down lately are beginning to disappear. You're about to regain all of your physical energy. If you overindulge, your energy level is likely to plummet once again. If nothing else, you will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation, especially now. Don't overdo it!",Capricorn
"Oct 15, 2022 - An intriguing new neighbor, perhaps someone you're attracted to, could move in near you, Capricorn. This might prove very exciting. You will probably strike up a conversation and enjoy talking with him or her. Whether you choose to pursue this attraction depends on both of your current situations, but at the very least, you will make a new friend.",Capricorn
"Oct 16, 2022 - Do your best to keep up today, Capricorn. Things might move quickly. You may be raising your hand and waiting politely for someone to call on you. This is one of those days in which other people will be so concerned about themselves that they probably won't notice you at all. If you want to take your turn, you should probably just stand up and be proactive.",Capricorn
"Oct 17, 2022 - Information you receive today may get you stirred up, Capricorn. Remember that it takes two to start an argument. You play an equal part in any disagreement. If you want to promote peace and harmony, your words and body language must show this. If peace and harmony aren't your ultimate goal, you may need to look inside yourself to explore the reasons why.",Capricorn
"Oct 18, 2022 - You might feel like you're getting worked up from all angles today, Capricorn. Find comfort in knowing that things will definitely improve by tomorrow. You might get the feeling that somehow you're all alone despite the circle of friends that surrounds and loves you. You may be called to action by a strong force. Try to stay abreast of information and developments around you so you can make the most informed decisions possible.",Capricorn
"Oct 19, 2022 - You might experience a bit of an internal conflict today and be you're unsure how to proceed, Capricorn. One side feels an urge to fight, while another side - a more mental aspect - asks you to keep this urge under wraps. It could be that this conflict keeps you immobile because of your lack of confidence in either camp. Try not to get stressed out over any one issue.",Capricorn
"Oct 20, 2022 - You may feel like the world is caving in on you in many ways today, Capricorn. It could be that you've recently dug your own little cave to crawl into and be safe from the outside world. Realize that the deeper you dig in unstable terrain, the more unsteady the walls. If you aren't careful, it's likely to come crashing down on top of you.",Capricorn
"Oct 21, 2022 - Tap into the boisterous, lighthearted mood of the day instead of getting bogged down with heavy emotions, Capricorn. This is a good time to engage your mind rather than let your heart take control. Be aware of the expansive nature of the day that allows you to think clearly without getting bothered by emotions. Take the cerebral route to figuring out what you need to do to smooth any bumps in the road.",Capricorn
"Oct 22, 2022 - A minor and rather silly quarrel with a friend or romantic partner could have you down in the dumps. This is an overreaction, Capricorn. You might need to get away for a while before you can make sense of it all. Too many demands from others could have you feeling used, and you might be tempted to tell them off. Try to avoid others long enough to gain control of yourself.",Capricorn
"Oct 23, 2022 - Are you spending a lot of time working on something you've been trying to learn well? It could be more confusing than usual today, Capricorn. You might come across a new concept that doesn't quite make sense to you at first glance. Don't waste time puzzling over it. Think about something else. The meaning of it all should come to you out of the blue. Be patient.",Capricorn
"Oct 24, 2022 - Technology could pave the way for you to greatly increase your income, possibly through new skills or investments. This is likely to be a very positive development, setting the stage for future financial success. Some unusual, interesting dreams could come your way, bringing unexpected revelations about you and your past - and possibly your future. Write them down! They could hold important messages for you from your higher self.",Capricorn
"Oct 25, 2022 - Today you might feel too overwrought to concentrate on whatever goals you're trying to reach, particularly if they're financial. Past issues might crop up at inopportune times but will still need to be released. If you aren't careful, this could get in the way of just about anything you need to do. Keeping cool is the most important thing to remember.",Capricorn
"Oct 26, 2022 - Computer glitches or bank errors might send erroneous information to you about your finances. Perhaps the bank says you have less money than you do, or a bill is higher than you thought it should be. If you can, make sure it gets settled today. You won't want to spend your day under this cloud. You will probably want to indulge in total frivolity. Go ahead, Capricorn, you deserve it!",Capricorn
"Oct 27, 2022 - Small social events and group activities are on the agenda today if at all possible, Capricorn. You may be introduced to someone who could prove helpful to your career. A letter containing good news could come from a friend or partner. Any new moneymaking enterprise begun now is likely to succeed as long as you stay with it and continue to face it in a businesslike manner.",Capricorn
"Oct 28, 2022 - Relatives or neighbors may come to you today asking for favors. Some may know exactly what buttons to push in order to get you to do what they want. Don't be sucked into guilt or other negative emotions. Help others if you wish, Capricorn, but recognize that you're doing it because you want to and not because you feel you have to. You might even learn something about yourself in the process.",Capricorn
"Oct 29, 2022 - Have you and a friend been discussing the possibility of going into business together? If so, Capricorn, the two of you might want to have some serious discussions now about the nature of the business, how it should be structured, and what the financial arrangements may be. You're both sharp enough to see both the promise and the downside of your enterprise. Get some paper and pens and go to it!",Capricorn
"Oct 30, 2022 - Magical events may occur today in the most unlikely places, Capricorn. Perhaps you're expecting to see someone in a certain environment. Even if you don't see him or her there, you will end up meeting at a special event in an entirely different place. Let your goal be your main focus. Let the details of the journey fall into place however they will.",Capricorn
"Oct 31, 2022 - There might be some unexpected communication coming from a long-lost friend or old roommate today, Capricorn. You never know whom you might run into when you leave the house, so stay alert. An old teacher could be just around the corner. Perhaps a bizarre news story in the paper catches your attention, because there on the page is a photo of the kid who lived next door to your childhood home.",Capricorn
"Nov 1, 2022 - When it comes to romance, your body is apt to turn to jelly today. You may be so emotional that you can't function, Capricorn. That's love. And even though it can be heavenly, it can also be debilitating. You could deliberate for hours about an issue because you don't want to make a move without your partner's input. If you don't have a romantic partner now, find one soon, but not today.",Capricorn
"Nov 2, 2022 - Too much running around might have you feeling exhausted and under the weather today, Capricorn. You may have been exercising a little too much. Therefore, this is a good day to avoid exercise and get some rest. Don't push yourself too hard! This isn't a good day to plan or start a vacation. Wait a few days, as trips planned at this time could be fraught with glitches.",Capricorn
"Nov 3, 2022 - If you feel you've been looking to the past lately, Capricorn, it's in order to liberate yourself from it. You may feel like revisiting your childhood or rekindling certain relationships with old friends. But the planets are making you a bit too romantic, and the reality of things will disappoint you. Looking backward isn't the best way to move toward the future. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be!",Capricorn
"Nov 4, 2022 - You may have spent the past few weeks exploring new horizons, talking to new people, going out more frequently in the evening, when possible, or even making short trips away from home. But this is a moment to settle down. Today's celestial configuration is giving you the incentive you need to stabilize yourself. Expect some pleasurable moments in the comfort of your home, Capricorn.",Capricorn
"Nov 5, 2022 - Love and passion are at the forefront of your thoughts today, Capricorn. Work seems tedious compared to the rich fantasy inside your head! If possible, make a point of getting together tonight with your mate. He or she is likely feeling as amorous as you. You two have much to celebrate. The celestial atmosphere is conducive to the deepening of your relationship.",Capricorn
"Nov 6, 2022 - You could develop a stomachache if you try to sort out all the confused issues of the day, Capricorn. There are apt to be too many matters for you to handle alone, so don't even try. It's one of those situations in which you start to untangle one knot only to create another somewhere down the line. It's best to just let the ball of string lie where it is for now.",Capricorn
"Nov 7, 2022 - This isn't a day for sensitive people like you, Capricorn. In fact, the one who shouts the loudest and bangs on the table the hardest is likely to come out the winner today. The air of violence will also have an effect on you. You will be somewhat upset, very thin-skinned, and much more vulnerable than usual. It would be wise to try to stay away from commotion if you can.",Capricorn
"Nov 8, 2022 - As a person who embodies affection and tenderness, Capricorn, you may feel especially resentful about today's mood. It will be difficult to charm a smile out of anyone or achieve any semblance of harmony. Moreover, the friction won't spare siblings - even close friends may quarrel. Prepare to duck and cover because clashes are likely to occur all around you.",Capricorn
"Nov 9, 2022 - Is there someone persecuting you, Capricorn? Is there a situation that feels unbearably oppressive? Today you won't have any trouble identifying the source of your problems. And the great news is that is the first step toward obtaining release from them. But you can't expect it to be easy. The day ahead may feel somewhat overwhelming.",Capricorn
"Nov 10, 2022 - Capricorn, you're someone who needs to have a lot of time to yourself. You often dream of curling up in bed with a good book or going for a bike ride. This is just your natural rhythm. Don't try and ignore it, because doing so could only mean problems for you. Give in from time to time. If you don't, at least use today to think about how you could.",Capricorn
"Nov 11, 2022 - Come out of your shell and be proud of your sensitive side, Capricorn. Although you may feel vulnerable when it comes to love and romance, this doesn't mean that you have to hide it. You may think that everyone else has it together in this department, but don't be fooled. They're just as insecure as you are! Go ahead and let this side of your personality shine. Admitting your vulnerability is wonderfully attractive.",Capricorn
"Nov 12, 2022 - Have you ever thought of yourself as a CEO or any other kind of leader, Capricorn? Today is a great day to begin a project involving other people - with you in charge! The strong, assertive side of your personality will come out in your decision making and charisma. Go for it! After all, this is the first day of the rest of your life.",Capricorn
"Nov 13, 2022 - Your career and financial goals should be within your grasp, Capricorn. Both your physical energy and inner power are operating at their peak, making this an ideal day to make clear plans. Also, if you've been working to improve your health, you might see some definite results. If not, this is a great day to start a new health and exercise regimen. Go to it!",Capricorn
"Nov 14, 2022 - Inspiration in various contexts could fill your mind today, Capricorn. Opportunities to advance your artistic or spiritual interests could come your way, perhaps through advice given by a new acquaintance. You could also be in the right place at the right time to get a lucky break. You're likely to feel especially romantic and sexy. You might want to celebrate your good fortune by getting together with your partner.",Capricorn
"Nov 15, 2022 - Today's energy may highlight your popularity, Capricorn. The transits boost your enthusiasm and energy for doing things. People will feel drawn to you. You might even find that others look up to you. This kind of popularity can make you feel special and lucky. On the flip side, it can make you think you're better than you are. Don't get carried away. Use this influence for good.",Capricorn
"Nov 16, 2022 - Take it slow and easy today, Capricorn. With the energy from the day's aspects, rushing around isn't likely to get you too far. In fact, you're more apt to make mistakes or leave a bunch of things unfinished. Make your to-do list and go about each thing one at a time at an even pace. Even if you don't finish everything, what you accomplish will be done well.",Capricorn
"Nov 17, 2022 - You may have a hard time relating to people in social situations, Capricorn. Perhaps you're frustrated at hearing the same shallow conversations over and over. While you have to mingle (even virtually) with different people, all you can think about is how nice it would be if you could be alone in front of the TV. Your best plan is to avoid situations that you know you won't enjoy. There's no sense in torturing yourself.",Capricorn
"Nov 18, 2022 - This is the type of day you enjoy. The climate is positive, and the energy is flowing. It's as though you have a magic wand. You give it a wave and - presto - the day's tasks and chores are done! By this evening, you've scarcely tapped your energy levels. Your family will be very happy to spend some quality time with you.",Capricorn
"Nov 19, 2022 - Stop asking if you're gifted, Capricorn. This definitely isn't the time for such questions. Now is the time to work on something concrete. You will need the help of others if you're to succeed, so get to work convincing them to ally with you. You may have to reveal more of yourself than you normally do in order to sway people to your side. It's time to get out of your hole and take action!",Capricorn
"Nov 20, 2022 - Today, Capricorn, you're in the mood for commitment! Take time to connect with the social world as you seek like-minded people who can share your intimate, individualistic realm. Ultimately, we all have to figure out how to make our way in society. Today you will feel more sociable than usual. Expect to have some good ideas about ways you can enlarge your social circle.",Capricorn
"Nov 21, 2022 - The possibility to advance your career through increasing your technological skills may present itself today. This could open doors for you in a lot of directions, paving the way for increased income. A number of new contacts could come into your life, bringing friendship and opportunities. This is the day to work on building your skills and possibly return to school.",Capricorn
"Nov 22, 2022 - Are you feeling scattered, Capricorn? It's possible that you're wondering about a million different things today. Are you strong enough to assume your family duties? Are you attractive? Are you important? Of course, all these questions simply distract you from your anxiety. Don't worry. The next few weeks will be less stressful.",Capricorn
"Nov 23, 2022 - It could be that close friends or family members are in sharp disagreement regarding a certain issue, Capricorn. Try not to be too distressed by divisions among the people you love. Some may want you to take sides and express yourself fully on the situation. You may feel as if you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Try your best to compromise.",Capricorn
"Nov 24, 2022 - Small group functions and social events might not prove as satisfying as usual today, Capricorn. You may not be in the mood. You might feel pressured to mingle when you'd rather sit on the couch. Whatever conversations you get into will seem trivial and boring. This is a good day to sit back and listen. You might learn from the people around you without having to say a word.",Capricorn
"Nov 25, 2022 - Guard your heart today, Capricorn, for it's a prime target of the abrasive words flying around. Your sensitive nature feels alone and vulnerable in this harsh atmosphere, so you might be better off just staying in bed. If you decide to go out, make sure to bring your arsenal. Use your sensitivity to your advantage. Scope out your weaknesses so you're able to use your energy most efficiently.",Capricorn
"Nov 26, 2022 - This is a confusing period for all of us, Capricorn. But no doubt you've noticed this. In such circumstances, some people become more rigid than ever because they resist dramatic change. They try to hold on to tradition. Your Capricorn sensitivity makes you very receptive to the past, but current conditions should inspire you to let go of some of your convictions.",Capricorn
"Nov 27, 2022 - Your passions have been stirring like a caged animal for the past several days, Capricorn. Now is the time to let them out. Some of what you express may elicit surprise or disapproval, but that's no reason to stay silent. If you don't express yourself, illness may result. Your goal should be to be true to your inner self. Ultimately, that's the only way to be happy and healthy.",Capricorn
"Nov 28, 2022 - There may be a bit of aggravation in a part of your life that's urging you to get up and do something, Capricorn. It could be that you're getting overly emotional about a certain issue, and that you need to consider more of the cold, hard facts of what's really going on. You could be missing something obvious simply because you're so caught up in your emotional drama.",Capricorn
"Nov 29, 2022 - Have sympathy for those who need to vent today, Capricorn. Don't be surprised if people line up outside your door for a chance to bend your ear for an hour or two. Your mind is sharp. You will be able to see to the core of any issue brought before you. More than likely, you will understand things intuitively. People will do well to take your advice on any issue they have.",Capricorn
"Nov 30, 2022 - Finally, you're on the mend, Capricorn. The minor ailments that have been dragging you down lately are beginning to disappear, and you're about to regain all of your physical energy. However, if you overindulge, your energy levels are likely to plummet again. If nothing else, you will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation, especially now. Don't overdo it!",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2023 - No matter what friends tell you, Capricorn, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",Capricorn
"Dec 1, 2022 - An electrifying attraction to someone you may have just met could cause your mind to dwell on sex and romance today, Capricorn. If you can, set up a romantic evening with a love partner. If this isn't possible, watch a movie that moves you to tears. Movies may be of particular interest to you today, since you might be reading about how they're made.",Capricorn
"Dec 2, 2022 - You may find that you're taking a much more daring approach when it comes to love and romance now, Capricorn. If you aren't, then maybe you should. You will never know the possibilities until you at least give it a try. You may find that there's something spurring you on today. Use that impulse to initiate a new path toward the object of your desire.",Capricorn
"Dec 3, 2022 - Walk to the beat of your own drum, Capricorn. If you try to latch on to the glib, fast-paced information of the day, you might lose your voice in the crowd. On the other hand, if you plant your feet firmly and try to plan in too much detail, you might deprive yourself of spontaneous events that prove fulfilling. Chart your own course, and don't be afraid if no one else comes along.",Capricorn
"Dec 4, 2022 - Make sure you get your daily dose of laughter and try to come out of your shell a bit more, Capricorn. This is an important time for you to let go of your inhibitions and open up to the world. You may find that there's a sober tone to your emotions, but you can overcome this easily as long as you keep your chin up. There's no reason for you to be gloomy.",Capricorn
"Dec 5, 2022 - Communication is a key part of the day, Capricorn. You will find that a great deal of information is available to you when you ask for it. You can pull from many different resources, so don't be afraid to tap the different wells available to you. Emotionally, this may not be the best day for you, but you can overcome this as long as you keep a lighthearted, optimistic approach.",Capricorn
"Dec 6, 2022 - You're going to think this is a strange period. It isn't, Capricorn. It's just that today won't be like others. Look around and you will see that people are either depressed or trying to keep up a good façade. It's as if lots of people - you in particular - are being confronted by their dreams without being able to act on them. This isn't an easy situation to be in.",Capricorn
"Dec 7, 2022 - If you're involved in an occupation similar to that of your mother or father, Capricorn, today you may question if the choice was yours or preordained. Did you take this career path of your own volition? If not, what is it that you should really be doing with your professional life? You feel rebellious and yearn for more independence. You might want to find more freedom within the confines of your existing career.",Capricorn
"Dec 8, 2022 - Money matters look uncertain and a bit deceptive, Capricorn. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of investment program, negotiate salaries or commissions, or change banks. Your dreams may be a bit disturbing, but this likely reflects fears from the past rather than dangers in the future. Write them down, however. You may learn a lot about yourself by studying the symbols.",Capricorn
"Dec 9, 2022 - The desire to beautify your home could hit you full force today, Capricorn. Perhaps you're expecting future visitors or house guests and want to make a good impression. You could prowl through online antique stores looking for knickknacks. You might set your sights on doing something a bit more ambitious than you originally planned. Enjoy yourself but be careful. You don't want to tire yourself out.",Capricorn
"Dec 10, 2022 - Arguments over money might come up, Capricorn. This might not involve your own funds but money belonging to a group with which you're involved. Try to be logical. This isn't a good day to set your sights on new goals or make definite plans. Wait a day or two. If you start today, your project could be fraught with delays, interruptions, or disagreements.",Capricorn
"Dec 11, 2022 - Let your sensual, nurturing instincts shine through, Capricorn. Rely on your sixth sense. If things start to get rough, remember that you have the ability to keep your cool. Not only is this an extremely important tool but it's also essential to maintaining any sort of stability in the situation. Keep your footing at all times. Your sanity depends on it.",Capricorn
"Dec 12, 2022 - Be careful of the information that comes your way today, Capricorn. People may make unwarranted claims and false accusations. The day has a dreamy, innovative quality to it that asks you to venture out on a limb. If all your chores are taken care of, feel free to go exploring - mentally or physically. Just make sure that you take things with a grain of salt when conversing with others.",Capricorn
"Dec 13, 2022 - The key today is action, Capricorn. There's a great deal of force pressuring you to get the ball rolling. One of these forces may come from a romantic interest waiting for you to make the next move. You may have many projects on the table and be unsure where to focus your energy. Don't feel like you need to concentrate on any one thing. They key is to maintain balance among all.",Capricorn
"Dec 14, 2022 - It may be hard to deal with the opposing energies today, Capricorn. Conflicting viewpoints and twisted perspectives clash within your world. Your emotions may pin you to one side of the issue, while a powerful force pulls you to believe in a more revolutionary approach. Try to maintain a balance in all situations, especially those that involve the sensitive emotions of others.",Capricorn
"Dec 15, 2022 - Lie low during the day and try not to get caught up in the frivolous verbiage that dominates the waking hours. After sundown, feel free to speak your mind. You may notice that there is a sober tone and restrictive sensation today that leaves you feeling like you will never be able to break free from your current situation. Don't get caught in this negative mindset.",Capricorn
"Dec 16, 2022 - Bring your emotions down to Earth today, Capricorn. Your imagination may run away with you. If you don't take a hard look at reality, you may find yourself in big trouble later. The higher you soar, the harder you fall. Make sure you have a working parachute. Be realistic about your current situation and act with confidence. Make sure you have the facts before you set goals and plans.",Capricorn
"Dec 17, 2022 - Be conscious of your own needs, Capricorn, and feel free to be a little selfish. Give yourself the credit you deserve, and don't let other people bully you into feeling like you aren't worthy of the attention you receive. You have a great number of gifts to offer the world, and you shouldn't be afraid to show them off. Lighten up and be proud. Other people are lucky to know you.",Capricorn
"Dec 18, 2022 - One thing is for sure, Capricorn, you'd rather be in bed with a good book than out in the stressful world. But you may be feeling like you're missing out on some of the good things in life. How much time do you spend with other people? Why not try to find someone who shares your taste for good books and bed? Think about it!",Capricorn
"Dec 19, 2022 - You may be inclined to stay in bed today with the latest best seller, Capricorn. Who wouldn't want to spend the day this way? Alas, that isn't going to happen. The planets are practically pulling the covers off you and pushing you out of bed. There's work to be done! And more importantly, there are people you need to talk to right now. Put a bookmark in the book. It can wait.",Capricorn
"Dec 20, 2022 - You may feel a bit tied down today. It won't necessarily be a bad day, but you may wonder about certain aspects of your family life. Don't try and kid yourself. You should think hard about what you want for your family for the next few years and how you intend to go about getting it.",Capricorn
"Dec 21, 2022 - Today is excellent for you, Capricorn. You will find that things flow naturally in the very way you've visualized. You might even find that things actually go much better than you had envisioned! Go about your endeavors confidently. The whole world isn't out to get you. In fact, people are probably too concerned with themselves to even bother with what you're doing.",Capricorn
"Dec 22, 2022 - Today is an excellent day for you, Capricorn. You will be a welcome addition to any crowd. Your delightful nature is at its most active. You have the unique capability to be aggressive about getting what you want without disturbing the flow of the energy around you. People respect and honor your sensitive, nurturing qualities. This will win the game for you.",Capricorn
"Dec 23, 2022 - This dreamy day is tailor made to your sensibilities. You may find it hard to focus on the daily issues when you're caught up in your fantasies. Go ahead and give in to the day's dreamlike state. Write in your journal or spend some time rummaging around in the attic. You'll be amazed at what you find. Expect to spend hours looking through scrapbooks and reliving your childhood.",Capricorn
"Dec 24, 2022 - Forget about work for a change and focus instead on your love life! This is one area that can really use some attention. There's no sense waiting for your partner to do it. It's up to you. Why not book a romantic weekend? It will do wonders for your relationship and add spark just by anticipating the fun you will have. Your commitment should mean more than your independence.",Capricorn
"Dec 25, 2022 - Just when you thought that the whole world was turning on you, Capricorn, things start to come back around. You will find that you don't need to hide. In fact, the more you let your true spirit emerge, the more allies you will gain. Your secret ambition to rule your world is becoming a much more attainable goal than you might have thought at first.",Capricorn
"Dec 26, 2022 - There's a call for you to focus on tangible items today, Capricorn. Your emotions may be a bit restricted, but you will find comfort in beautiful, luxurious surroundings. Don't be surprised if people are a bit more critical than usual. What they intend as helpful may come across as hurtful. Try to keep a positive spin on things or you may slip down a negative spiral of self-pity.",Capricorn
"Dec 27, 2022 - What changes have there been in your life since this time last year? Think about the events that have taken place. What have you accomplished? What decisions have you made? And most importantly, how much you have grown as a person? Try to make changes by following your intuition. Even though it seems stressful and sometimes painful, change means growth!",Capricorn
"Dec 28, 2022 - You may come in contact with someone today with whom you enjoy a highly emotional exchange. You may even fall in love! Be very attentive to your moods and everything going on inside you, Capricorn. They will be particularly strong, and they will help you understand what is changing in you. Just be careful to distinguish your feelings from those of your (future?) partner.",Capricorn
"Dec 29, 2022 - You're usually good at bringing people together. Your greatest strength is giving identity to those people who seek it. In fact, you're so aware of the differences between people that you resist the changes that come about as people evolve. Today's planetary alignment confronts you with issues that concern your future. Your position will help you accept things and go forward.",Capricorn
"Dec 30, 2022 - It takes two to tango, Capricorn. Remember that life isn't a one-way street. There needs to be a bit of give and take if you expect others to treat you the way you want to be treated. Don't let people take control when it comes to taking charge of your own life. Others may be emotional and stubborn. Don't waste your breath with useless drivel. Say something meaningful.",Capricorn
"Dec 31, 2022 - Issues having to do with love and romance are in your favor today, Capricorn. You're more in touch with your emotions. You will find that your attitude toward love is more grounded than usual. Feel free to let go of some control. Let fate take you where it will in this department. Also make sure that you don't worry so much about things. Worrying will cause doubt, something you don't need.",Capricorn
"Feb 4, 2023 - More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Aquarius. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius

"Feb 4, 2022 - The effect from the planetary aspects will bring an end to any lethargy you've been feeling, Aquarius. It's an excellent day to get up and head into the open to do something active. Walking, running, or going on a hike can make great use of both your energy and creativity. Fresh air and physical exertion will lend much to your health as well, so make the most of this. Even if you have to work today, you can always enjoy the evening.",Acquarius
"Feb 5, 2022 - You might discover that someone close to you, a family member perhaps, could use a hand today, Aquarius. Chances are good, too, that he or she won't ask for help out of pride. Don't let that stop you, though. If you recognize a situation where you can be of assistance, go for it. Don't wait for an invitation or request. Simply take hold of the circumstances and do what you can. Your efforts will be appreciated and you'll leave feeling terrific that you could make a difference.",Acquarius
"Feb 6, 2022 - Today you might want to talk over any plans you have or would like to make with those you live with, Aquarius. If you live alone, there isn't much chance that your plans will affect anyone, but for those of you cohabiting with others, take time to extend this courtesy. It might be that someone else in the house had some intentions that you weren't aware of, or there may be someone in need of something from you. Talk things over and everything will work out just fine.",Acquarius
"Feb 7, 2022 - Take the time to consider your physical and mental health today, Aquarius. Given your hard-driving nature, these are areas that may be neglected. One really affects the other. If you overwork your brain or put off dealing with problems, your physical health will suffer. Things like excess weight, addiction, and bouts of depression are all indicators that there is an imbalance in your life. See about getting things more in sync.",Acquarius
"Feb 8, 2022 - See about getting as active as possible today, Aquarius. This could really give your overall health a boost, especially if you've been sedentary lately. Try something fun like engaging in sports or taking a pooch for a walk. Gardening and cutting the lawn are other activities that are better for you than sitting all day. The physical movement can reduce stress and give you a sense of accomplishment. Every part of you benefits from being active. Check it out.",Acquarius
"Feb 9, 2022 - Today you're likely to complete a creative project of some kind that you’ve been working on for some time, Aquarius. You might want to consult with friends or colleagues, get their feedback on what you're doing, and listen to their advice. They may point out both strong and weak points of which you were previously unaware, and this should definitely prove valuable to you. The results you achieve could surprise even you. Go for it!",Acquarius
"Feb 10, 2022 - Today you're likely to be longing for a little break from your daily routine, Aquarius, and for an evening alone with a love partner. You're feeling sensual and passionate, but you also have much to report concerning new opportunities that have recently come up. Some of these, if implemented, could well change your life in a profound way. You'll want your partner's opinion, since it concerns him or her as well. Choose your words carefully and get the enthusiasm going!",Acquarius
"Feb 11, 2022 - Paperwork involving money might seem a bit overwhelming today, Aquarius, and you might ask a friend for advice or assistance. This person probably knows what it's all about, so listen even though you might not understand much of what he or she says! Financial benefits could be in the wind. You may be entertaining outrageous fantasies of what you're going to buy with it all. Dream all you want, but be practical when the windfall comes!",Acquarius
"Feb 12, 2022 - There is a rough stubbornness to the day that you may find hinders your progress, Aquarius. There may be undercurrents of opposition that are slowly wearing away at your psyche. Make sure that you don't fall into the trap of feeling guilt or regret. These are useless emotions that you simply can do without. If people are being negative or unreasonable, simply walk away from the situation and find a better one.",Acquarius
"Feb 13, 2022 - Get-togethers with friends today could prove a bit unsettling, Aquarius, as someone who attends them could throw out an opinion or possibility that seems rather shocking. This opinion, however, is likely to be based on rumor, gossip, and other misinformation, so it would be a good idea to suggest that these concepts be explored in order to ascertain the facts. They'll probably turn out to be far more positive than you hear today.",Acquarius
"Feb 14, 2022 - This should be a very busy day for you, Aquarius, as communications involving business matters could take up much of your time. These could concern your own goals or those of a friend or a group with which you're affiliated. Whatever it is, you should feel a strong sense of elation and optimism. Success is definitely in the wind. However, try not to exhaust yourself. Take occasional breaks. Don't forget that you'll need to keep going tomorrow.",Acquarius
"Feb 15, 2022 - Your home might need some work today, Aquarius. You and other members of your household could decide to join forces and get everything done. This might simply involve a thorough cleaning, or it could mean major repairs of some sort, perhaps plumbing or electrical. If the latter, it isn't a good idea to try to do this yourself. There could be factors involved that are more complicated than they seem. Don't be afraid to call in a professional.",Acquarius
"Feb 16, 2022 - Today, Aquarius, you might find yourself getting more irritated than you usually would at the quirks of friends, colleagues, partners, and children. Nerves could be frayed and tempers around you frazzled. At times like this it's best to remain centered and make the effort to be your usual warm and friendly self. No lasting rifts are likely to result, but tension with others can make for an uncomfortable day.",Acquarius
"Feb 17, 2022 - You can count on a very idyllic and romantic day today, Aquarius. You’re feeling especially warm and sensual, and you tend to view the partner in your life through rose-colored glasses. He or she is very likely to regard you in the same way. If you've been longing for a dinner for two, complete with champagne, candlelight, and red roses, this is the day to go for it. And don't forget the violin music!",Acquarius
"Feb 18, 2022 - Uneasy feelings may be plaguing you throughout the day, Aquarius. There could appear to be no valid reason for this. Everything seems to be going well for you, and no one close to you has anything heavy going on. It's probably nothing Earthshaking. You may just be intuitively picking up on the troubles and anxieties of people you pass on the street. Your intuition is high today, so you could psychically sense just about anything. Hang in there!",Acquarius
"Feb 19, 2022 - Sex and romance are very much on your mind today, Aquarius. You’re feeling especially passionate, and your emotions are rich and deep. At times like this you’re likely to want to concentrate on your own pleasure, yet it’s important to be sensitive to your partner as well. Racy novels and movies could be especially appealing, and you might toy with the idea of shopping at Victoria's Secret. Go for it!",Acquarius
"Feb 20, 2022 - Career matters could move so slowly today that you just might be tempted to give up, Aquarius. Don't even think that way! It's just one of those days when nothing seems to go right, even though basically everything should still be going very well for you. Don't expect much progress today, and certainly don't expect anything but gloom from colleagues. Put a calendar with cartoons on the wall so you can distract yourself with some laughs throughout the day.",Acquarius
"Feb 21, 2022 - No sooner do you set foot in the office this morning than you begin to get pelted from all directions with various crises and problems, Aquarius. It isn’t a very welcome reception. A hot cup of coffee and a warm greeting from your co-workers would be a much nicer way to start the day. Take it all in stride. You have the brainpower and stamina to solve all the day's problems.",Acquarius
"Feb 22, 2022 - A change of scene is in store for you, Aquarius. It’s unclear whether or not this is a voluntary move, but it’s clear that chaos and confusion reign over the next few days. There is much to be done. Fortunately, your organizational abilities will serve you well. You don your general's hat, wield your clipboard like a sword, and get everybody doing your bidding. The move is completed in record time!",Acquarius
"Feb 23, 2022 - Today you might find yourself compelled to stay at home for some reason, Aquarius. Perhaps you're expecting a visitor who's late or a delivery of some kind. Therefore, you could feel somewhat antsy. You like staying home, but only if you choose to do so. Find something creative to fill the time you have to spend waiting. That might make you feel as if you're choosing even if you aren't.",Acquarius
"Feb 24, 2022 - Your creative nature will no longer be repressed, Aquarius! As you look around your home, you realize you feel the need to spruce it up a bit. Motivated by a desire to give dinner parties and invite family members who live far away to come for a visit, you get to work repainting, wallpapering, and maybe even sending that sofa out to be reupholstered. The final result will be fantastic, Aquarius. You’ll be proud.",Acquarius
"Feb 25, 2022 - Be sure to open your mail and answer the phone today, Aquarius, as you’re likely to receive some interesting information from a friend or business associate. It could be that a deal that's been in the works has just been signed, or a romantic interest you've been pursuing finally returns your affections. Whatever the day brings, it’s likely to be favorable.",Acquarius
"Feb 26, 2022 - Misinformation is likely to spread like wildfire today, causing a lot of unnecessary upset either among your neighbors at home or your colleagues at work. Don't accept at face value any gossip or rumor you hear, Aquarius. Check the accuracy of the information yourself. If it does turn out to be false, as is likely, you'll feel sorry if you've had any part in perpetuating it.",Acquarius
"Feb 27, 2022 - A rebirth of romance in your life could take place today, Aquarius. If you're currently involved with someone, a happy event could enrich the bond between you and bring you closer together. If you aren't presently attached, you could be by the end of the day. You might meet someone new and exciting, probably an intelligent person who could be involved with modern technology. Make sure you look your best, and expect the unexpected!",Acquarius
"Feb 28, 2022 - You probably aren't feeling your best today, Aquarius. No doubt your illness is a result of recent overindulgence. You can't blame anyone but yourself for your crashing headache and queasy stomach. Try not to take your bad mood out on the family. Just ask them to close the curtains and shut the door. You will emerge in the early afternoon feeling a bit wobbly but definitely on the mend.",Acquarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Aquarius. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius

Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius
"Mar 1, 2022 - Be prepared today, Aquarius. A longtime dream regarding your career may finally become a reality. At first you might not believe it, fighting the news in order to avoid possible disappointment. Don't fall into this trap; it creates negative energy, which can get in your way. You've worked hard to be where you are, and you aren't likely to stop advancing. Accept your accolades, thank everyone, and then move on.",Acquarius
"Mar 2, 2022 - Your physical vitality is extra strong today, Aquarius, although your thoughts may be a little clouded. Someone could strongly object to an action of yours, but realize that their motivation may be a bit skewed. Muster the self-confidence to stand up for yourself at this time. Whatever happens, you'll be called on to take action one way or another. Take the time to assess the facts carefully, because there may be trickery going on.",Acquarius
"Mar 3, 2022 - Plans for getting together with friends or a romantic partner might have to be postponed because of professional responsibilities that need attention. This could prove upsetting, Aquarius, especially since you have to disappoint others, but these things happen. Don't let it get to you. This will have no lasting effect on any of your relationships. Work hard, get it done, and schedule time for some fun a bit later.",Acquarius
"Mar 4, 2022 - Sudden changes in your romantic situation could occur today, Aquarius. If you're currently committed to someone, expect some surprising propositions from your partner. If you're involved but not committed, a marriage proposal might be in the picture. If you aren't currently involved, you could meet someone new and exciting under unusual circumstances. Make sure you look your best today, even if you're only running down to the supermarket!",Acquarius
"Mar 5, 2022 - Take your leadership abilities to a new level, Aquarius. Gather some friends and plan a trip that you've long been considering but were reluctant to act on. People will naturally look to you for leadership and guidance, as you always seem to know how to keep things fun and positive. When it comes to your workplace, this might be a good time to ask for more responsibility - and a raise.",Acquarius
"Mar 6, 2022 - A selfish attitude on your part won't be tolerated today, regardless of the circumstances, Aquarius. Don't make it worse for yourself by pretending that you don't notice others' hurt feelings. People are likely to be extra sensitive today, so be careful about trying to impose your will on someone who really wants nothing more than an ear to talk to and a shoulder to cry on.",Acquarius
"Mar 7, 2022 - The more you can apply to your own life the advice you give to others, the better off you'll be, Aquarius. No one is going to follow a leader who doesn't abide by his or her own standards. If you're going to offer your guidance to someone else, make sure you're willing to operate by the same rules and accept feedback regarding their effectiveness.",Acquarius
"Mar 8, 2022 - You're in a romantic mood today, Aquarius. You're more likely to notice attractive strangers you pass on the street, and attract admiring glances from them! Racy novels and movies could seem more appealing than usual, and you might do some window-shopping for sensual products. This is definitely an evening to spend with that special person in your life. Have a professional style your hair to make sure you look your best!",Acquarius
"Mar 9, 2022 - You're being called upon to take action in many areas today, Aquarius. People may be tugging at you to be with them and participate in their world of fun and excitement. It could also be that there are many projects that catch your attention today, and you're conflicted about which ones to put your energy into. Friction may arise as you find yourself tearing away from one situation to participate in another.",Acquarius
"Mar 10, 2022 - There is a tremendous amount of physical energy building within you, Aquarius. Be careful that you don't let this incredible force come out in the form of a heated argument against someone you really care about. Perhaps you suddenly feel as if everything is caving in and you desperately need some means of escape. Go for a good long run. Find a way to release this tension.",Acquarius
"Mar 11, 2022 - The key word for you today is boundaries, Aquarius, so think for a minute about what this means to you. It's time to have a serious talk with yourself. Set some limits and be honest about drawing the line. Your health, your state of mind, and your relationships with others all depend on your taking the initiative to know when to say no in certain situations.",Acquarius
"Mar 12, 2022 - Your energy will light up any room you enter today, Aquarius. Feel free to take advantage of this incredible magnetism by initiating and encouraging others to join you in creative activities and bold adventures. However, be careful that your head doesn't get too big. You can be proud without becoming egotistical; otherwise you'll end up losing your followers before you even get started.",Acquarius
"Mar 13, 2022 - You should be feeling especially strong, healthy, and charismatic. You're likely to receive some invitations to exciting parties. You might be surprised at what seems a sudden increase in your popularity. Expanded career opportunities could also come your way from new acquaintances, and you could find doors opening to a whole new life - new friends, new position, and possibly a new home.",Acquarius
"Mar 14, 2022 - Today's energies are going to be stirring up everyone's emotions, Aquarius. You may wish to avoid getting involved in any arguments or conflicts. If you ask for someone else's advice, you're likely to get an earful. It may be best to keep to yourself as much as possible today and spend some time alone tonight with a good book. Everything should be much calmer tomorrow.",Acquarius
"Mar 15, 2022 - Communication problems might arise on the job. Perhaps a co-worker is in a bad mood and unreceptive to anything you say. Or perhaps the phones are out or the computers down. This could prove frustrating, Aquarius, and might interfere with relations among staff members. A phone call from a close friend or lover could go astray but reach you at the last minute. Don't worry; you'll still have a great evening!",Acquarius
"Mar 16, 2022 - In an effort to be the brightest and best star on the stage, Aquarius, you might actually be driving away the most important members of your audience. Make sure that you aren't putting on different masks with different people just so you can appease those you're with. Others can see right through any disguise you try to put on. Trying to deceive others is simply a sign of disrespect.",Acquarius
"Mar 17, 2022 - Paperwork regarding finances, possibly those connected with your job, might take up a lot of your time today, Aquarius. You should be feeling especially strong, confident, and focused, so if you've been thinking about looking for a new position, this is the day to check the ads. Advancement through your own efforts is strongly indicated by the aspects in force today.",Acquarius
"Mar 18, 2022 - You may feel as if people have turned against you today and that they've suddenly lost interest in what you have to say, Aquarius. Maybe this is a reflection of your own inability to truly listen to someone else talking. Look at the collective picture and open your eyes to the world around you. Get involved in the community instead of only focusing on you all the time.",Acquarius
"Mar 19, 2022 - The planetary energy has you feeling a bit sluggish today. You'll probably want to stay home, surrounded by your books, pets, and plants, yet you know you have appointments to keep and responsibilities to fulfill. Your sense of duty is especially strong. Make a deal with yourself to get the bare minimum done and then relax. Try a hot bath and listening to classical music.",Acquarius
"Mar 20, 2022 - A number of invitations to social events could come your way today, some from people you really don't know well. Don't pass them up, however. You could make some fortunate contacts or even some new friends at these parties. You enjoy being around people, Aquarius, but today you might find it a bit tedious. Your heart is with your family. You're probably looking forward to being at home and cuddling with a romantic partner.",Acquarius
"Mar 21, 2022 - You're a gregarious person by nature, Aquarius, and today you might want to socialize and enjoy yourself. You could be overly concerned with your appearance, possibly because you wish to impress a current or potential romantic partner. Don't worry; they'll think you look great. You could receive a lot of attention throughout the evening both from this person and others, which will cement the bonds you feel with all your friends. Enjoy!",Acquarius
"Mar 22, 2022 - Your innate charm and good manners have brought you good relationships with both co-workers and superiors, and today you might find that this has served you well, Aquarius. Authority figures may seem a little intimidating, but hang on to your self-confidence. Hard work and dedication have also brought you some corporate kudos. Therefore, it's quite possible that you might hear of forthcoming career advancement. Onward and upward!",Acquarius
"Mar 23, 2022 - A fascinating article you read in the newspaper could inspire you to try to create a mystery story of your own, Aquarius. Today your mind is perfectly suited to devising plot twists and interesting but complex characters. You could tell the story to children, or you might even decide to turn it into a novel. Jot down your ideas and look at them again tomorrow. If you want to continue, then go for it!",Acquarius
"Mar 24, 2022 - Delays and frustrations could plague you throughout the day, Aquarius, especially regarding communications. A young visitor you're expecting at your home today could be delayed in some way and might not be able to call and let you know. Don't waste any time worrying. Your friend is probably safe and will eventually turn up. Congested traffic and other unforeseen annoyances are probably to blame. Hang in there.",Acquarius
"Mar 25, 2022 - Words of love, perhaps of a very idealistic nature, could be exchanged today between you and a romantic partner, Aquarius. One of you could even write a song or poem for the other. This can be a very healing and transformative experience, and could therefore make both of you feel very good. The only downside is that you could well view each other through rose-colored glasses. Remember that you're both human! Enjoy your day.",Acquarius
"Mar 26, 2022 - Expect today's planetary energies to raise your social consciousness, Aquarius. You may be distracted with thoughts of the homeless person you saw today, or the television special you saw on babies with AIDS. You may be reflecting on your connection to and responsibilities toward humanity. Why don't you put aside a little time or money for the charity of your choice? If you're feeling these urges, don't hesitate to act on them!",Acquarius
"Mar 27, 2022 - Social events today could put you in touch with people in the arts, Aquarius, particularly ones such as film, television, recording, and computer graphics that combine creativity with modern technology. If you're single, one might even be a potential romantic partner. If nothing else, these people could provide you with valuable insights and contacts so you can advance your own career, particularly if it's artistic in nature. Be attentive, and enjoy your evening.",Acquarius
"Mar 28, 2022 - An interest in health and nutrition could come to the surface for you, Aquarius. New discoveries regarding the benefits of certain nutrients, exercise programs, or other forms of alternative therapy could attract your attention. You might want to attend a lecture of some kind in order to learn more about it. You'll probably stick with any new program begun now, so go for it. Dare to strive for optimal health!",Acquarius
"Mar 29, 2022 - Love and romance continue to blossom, Aquarius. Social events could find you and your beloved among both old and new friends, perhaps letting some of them know for the first time that you're actually an item. Someone close to both of you could be planning a wedding and invite you to come. Don't be surprised if it gives your partner ideas! Let yourself dream a little today. You can face reality tomorrow.",Acquarius
"Mar 30, 2022 - Is your love interest out of town, Aquarius? If so, you might spend much of the day feeling lonely and gloomy. Your friend misses you, too, so don't think you'll be alone for long. Try to fill the hours until your partner returns with activities that you love, such as reading or artistic pursuits. The time should then go quickly and you'll be back together before you know it. Hang in there!",Acquarius
"Mar 31, 2022 - Love matters could appear to be moving far more slowly than you'd like, Aquarius. Both you and your romantic interest may be overloaded with responsibilities now and unable to see each other much. It's frustrating, but you'll get through it. In the meantime, don't let your insecurities get the better of you. Just because your friend is busy doesn't mean that your relationship is on the rocks. Be patient!",Acquarius
"Apr 1, 2022 - You might experience some mental distractions that pull you in different directions today, Aquarius. There could be a stubborn internal/external battle brewing. Realize that being in the middle is to your advantage. Look at the situation as a way to learn something about yourself and others. Understanding your opposition's viewpoint will help you. Incorporate the old and the new into your way of thinking.",Acquarius
"Apr 2, 2022 - You might be much more aware of yourself than usual and hyper-alert to every move you make today, especially around others, Aquarius. You're feeling self-conscious about your words, and you could be constantly wondering if you're saying the right thing to the right person at the right time. Too much self-analysis of could drive you completely insane if you aren't careful. Try not to take everything so seriously.",Acquarius
"Apr 3, 2022 - You could come into conflict with someone who has a very inclusive attitude, Aquarius. Perhaps he or she encourages a humanistic approach that you find unrealistic and even a bit offputting. State exactly how you feel, but make sure you have the facts to back up your point and prepare for a counter argument. A great deal of fantasy is tossed around as truth, so it's important that you not add to it.",Acquarius
"Apr 4, 2022 - After a few days that were a bit serious, Aquarius, today you awake with a light heart and boundless energy! Your capacity for seduction will be at its peak, so why not use it to your advantage? The men and women at work, in particular, will yield to your wishes today. Your influence extends to all levels of the organization. If you've been thinking about asking your boss for a raise, do it today!",Acquarius
"Apr 5, 2022 - It isn't always pleasant to have to question oneself, Aquarius, but this is the main objective of today's planetary energies - to launch you into new adventures. So take advantage of the configuration to look inside and find the source of some of your setbacks. This isn't an easy exercise, to be sure, but it will do you an enormous amount of good. Just be honest with yourself.",Acquarius
"Apr 6, 2022 - You could be feeling restless and frustrated due to a temporary separation from a partner, Aquarius, perhaps a business partner but more likely a romantic one. Phone contact could be difficult as well, because you could both be busy and keep missing each other. Find something fascinating to do that will take your mind off the situation. Get together with friends and have some fun. The time will pass more quickly.",Acquarius
"Apr 7, 2022 - Today you might feel the urge to write, Aquarius. This could involve nothing more than a lengthy letter or email to a friend, but it could also be creative work, such as a novel, essay, screenplay, or poem. Whatever it is, you're likely to express some intellectual, philosophical, or spiritual concerns that you hope to shed some light on. Don't be surprised if you come up with more questions than answers.",Acquarius
"Apr 8, 2022 - Money problems could be on your mind, Aquarius, perhaps more so than necessary. You might have a tendency to blow them out of proportion and think they're worse than they are. Try to make a special effort to be objective. You might need to cut a few corners and devise a few temporary economy measures, but your situation should be back to normal within a week or two. Relax!",Acquarius
"Apr 9, 2022 - A group of friends might want you to go out with them today, Aquarius, but you probably won't feel up to it. Your financial situation could also require a little belt-tightening now, so you may not feel you can justify the expense. In any case, you aren't going to want to spend the evening alone. Invite a friend or love partner over to watch a movie with you.",Acquarius
"Apr 10, 2022 - You've been juggling career, romance, and creative interests for the past year, Aquarius. This is apt to continue. However, you could find yourself building a new career involving writing or speaking, perhaps in addition to your current career. You're also apt to develop a vigorous interest in improving your health. You could make a powerful effort to change your diet and exercise habits. Good luck with it all!",Acquarius
"Apr 11, 2022 - Love and romance should be flying high for you now, Aquarius. If you're single, you could soon form an incredible relationship. If you're already involved, the spiritual and emotional bonds between you and your beloved should grow by leaps and bounds. The lines of communication are wide open. Make use of them and you may find the kind of love of which most people can only dream.",Acquarius
"Apr 12, 2022 - Boy, your life seems seriously out of balance, doesn't it, Aquarius? Today provides an opportunity to rethink what is truly important. Consider exercise as one way to improve your health and manage your stress level. Once you get started with a healthy regimen, you'll see how it helps you gain perspective. It's likely that the cause of all this stress can be eliminated when viewed through a different lens.",Acquarius
"Apr 13, 2022 - A friend or family member could be feeling rather grim, taciturn, and not open to communication. He or she could have you wondering if you've done something wrong, or they're angry with you. If you use your warmth and generosity of spirit to induce this person to open up, Aquarius, you'll probably find that the issues have nothing to do with you. You might even help relieve them! Tonight, prepare everyone's favorite meal.",Acquarius
"Apr 14, 2022 - You might find yourself unexpectedly busy today, Aquarius. It could be that you'd planned to spend the day tidying up and reorganizing your home. A change of plans could mean you spend most of the day at the office handling one crisis after another. Perhaps a friend calls in need of your help. You could find it difficult to switch gears, but by the end of the day you'll be happy that you could help.",Acquarius
"Apr 15, 2022 - There is a possibility that you'll fall into a bit of a regression today as old feelings of anxiety or inadequacy surface. Although you've reached a good place in terms of self-confidence, some old childhood fears could resurface. The old emotions that bubble up could impede your interactions with your co-workers or friends today, so be mindful of what lies under the surface for you, Aquarius.",Acquarius
"Apr 16, 2022 - It's likely that you'll receive some unpleasant news today, Aquarius. Perhaps there are changes occurring at work that you read about in the morning newspaper. Or it could be that you get a phone call and receive some upsetting news about an old friend. You'll need to take the information in stride and not let it ruin your day. With the intensity of the planetary energies at play, you're at risk of overreacting.",Acquarius
"Apr 17, 2022 - This is bound to be a wonderful day, Aquarius. You're looking and feeling great and it shows! This is a day of kindness and cooperation. You could find that your family pitches in to help at home without being asked. Your romantic partner might volunteer to clean out the garage and your children start to clean their rooms. This definitely isn't your typical day! Enjoy the harmony that reigns today.",Acquarius
"Apr 18, 2022 - Those who know the real you find your lack of confidence frustrating, Aquarius. Your talents are startling to mere mortals, yet you rarely take credit for all your abilities. Today you get an opportunity to participate in a project that could make or break your career. You may hesitate, weigh your capabilities in your mind, and come up short. Not only can you do this, you can do it better than anyone else!",Acquarius
"Apr 19, 2022 - The more you talk to people, the more successful you'll be, Aquarius. Everyone is a valuable resource, so tap in to this boundless well. Your agility with words and facts is impressive, so use it to your advantage. Friends are a source of great joy, and this is a wonderful time to be with them. For the most part, it doesn't matter what you're doing. The person you're with is what is important.",Acquarius
"Apr 20, 2022 - Are you having problems with the lighting or heating in your home, Aquarius? If so, you might not be able to get a professional out today. There could be problems in the entire neighborhood. You might have to get out the candles and flashlights to get you through the evening. Don't let this throw you. It's a minor inconvenience that will be fixed soon. Think of it as an adventure!",Acquarius
"Apr 21, 2022 - Communication with friends and partners should be clear, open, honest, and supportive today, Aquarius. Camaraderie flows freely, and affection is shown without restraint or overkill. If you're presently involved but not yet committed, a declaration of love and an expression of desire to move the relationship to the next level could be in the wind. At the very least, your lover should pay you a compliment or two!",Acquarius
"Apr 22, 2022 - Sex and romance are top priority for you today, Aquarius. You're looking especially beautiful, you're feeling especially sensual, and you could well attract admiring looks from strangers. You might want to indulge in some new clothes or perhaps new cologne. This is definitely the perfect day to schedule an intimate evening with a love partner. If you can, go for it. It might be a day or two before your schedules mesh, however. Be patient!",Acquarius
"Apr 23, 2022 - Love is very much in the air today, Aquarius, so take advantage of this auspicious environment! Invite your loved one over to play hide and seek under the bedcovers! Or, if you don't have a playmate in your life at the moment, find other ways to fulfill the passion you feel. Spend the afternoon reading a good novel or invite a friend to watch a movie with you. Have a good time!",Acquarius
"Apr 24, 2022 - Change is in the air, Aquarius. Whether it's a dramatic change of faith or a major shift in your life's goals, prepare yourself for a profound transformation. It's likely due to the fact that you now have more freedom to do what you want, when you want. Perhaps a financial windfall has made this possible. Take care to choose your new path wisely. It doesn't offer you the choice of returning to your old lifestyle.",Acquarius
"Apr 25, 2022 - You can relax a little at last! That's what you could be thinking with today's celestial energy. The time is perfect to get ready for the challenges that up to now were just anxieties inside you. If you're thinking clearly today, Aquarius, it's because you have the strength to face your problems. Now that you have your self-confidence back, you might open your heart even wider to someone dear.",Acquarius
"Apr 26, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you have a desire to redecorate. The celestial energies have put you in the mood to rearrange your house a bit. Take care to not go overboard, Aquarius. You have a tendency to turn little projects into big ones. For now, content yourself with buying some flowering plants and perhaps new area rugs and throw pillows. Leave the kitchen and bath renovations for later.",Acquarius
"Apr 27, 2022 - A member of your household could be going through some rough times, Aquarius, and as a result might become overly dependent on your moral and emotional support. This is flattering, but it could also be a drain on your energy. Carefully consider what you really need to say to your friend. Sometimes you have to hit a person over the head with the truth (figuratively speaking) in order to wake them up.",Acquarius
"Apr 28, 2022 - A festival, rally, or other mass event could occur today in your community, Aquarius. It could center on a social, ecological, or political issue. You could well decide to attend in the company of a romantic partner, and perhaps a group of friends, too. This event could prove exciting for you, although some of what you learn there might be unsettling. Take a notebook and plenty of pens. You'll want to keep a record.",Acquarius
"Apr 29, 2022 - A contract of some kind, perhaps involving the home, might need some careful consideration today, Aquarius. You could find it a little difficult to understand, as it could be full of fine print and legalese. Don't be afraid to ask someone with a little more savvy to explain what you're trying to read. It's important that you know all the ins and outs before signing anything, for your own peace of mind, if nothing else.",Acquarius
"Apr 30, 2022 - Today's planetary energies will be very demanding, Aquarius. As you agonize over whether or not you're up to “standard,"" the planets, in a very cheeky way, respond that you are not! That's because you're moving too quickly. The change in direction that you're making at the moment is profound, yet you're trying to take it lightly. Dare to slow down and go deeper.",Acquarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Aquarius. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius
"May 1, 2022 - When we have found our path, we naturally want to start to walk down it, Aquarius. The reverse isn't true despite what you seem to believe. It's quite futile to learn how to walk when you don't know which path to walk upon. This may seem a little obscure to you, and yet it's true. Desire is what creates aptitude, not the reverse.",Acquarius
"May 2, 2022 - This is your day to shine, Aquarius. Just make sure you don't do so at someone else's expense. You're feeling more self-confident than usual, which may be hard for you to believe. Nevertheless, you could be so focused on your agenda that you fail to see subtle signals put out by those around you. Other people cry out for attention, too. Make sure you shine some of your glorious light on them.",Acquarius
"May 3, 2022 - It's possible you could meet someone today who will act as a kind of Pygmalion for you. You need to be surrounded and encouraged by people who believe in you, Aquarius, and it's good for you have people around to support you. If you do meet this kind of person, don't be a showoff. Listen to what he or she has to say to you. It's for your own good.",Acquarius
"May 4, 2022 - Pivotal career matters may need to be thought through today, Aquarius. A lot could be at stake at work in the very near future. Whatever tasks you need to tend to could require a lot of effort and concentration. There's a danger of sinking into a gloomy mood over it, but try to avoid this trap. You'll probably accomplish whatever it is you're hoping to do, so hang onto that thought. Go to it!",Acquarius
"May 5, 2022 - An increased focus, clarity of mind, and sense of concentration could lead to success in career matters and increased income, Aquarius. Intuition can provide practical guidance to help you advance. A male friend might give you some good advice with regard to savings plans, investments, or a more efficient use of resources. This could be a fruitful day that opens new doors for you. Make the most of it!",Acquarius
"May 6, 2022 - Your physical strength is topnotch, Aquarius. Now is a terrific time to join a sports team or start a company soccer program. Others will respect your leadership abilities. Your glow as a self-confident, constructive being is radiating positive energy. This combination of forces is extremely powerful. You have the opportunity to be wonderfully productive at this time. Work and play are likely to present you with exciting opportunities for advancement.",Acquarius
"May 7, 2022 - Matters of the heart are likely to get a bit sticky, Aquarius. Perhaps you feel as if someone is shutting off from you and being very stubborn about it. Perhaps this person is giving you the cold shoulder and refusing to acknowledge you until you crawl back with an apology. The problem is that your pride is stubborn, and your view on the matter is equally so, making any resolution difficult.",Acquarius
"May 8, 2022 - Have you been reviewing your family history lately, Aquarius? Of special interest is your cultural background. What educational, social, and religious environment were you born into? What are its values? In the end, do you feel a strong affinity with them now or are those views different from the ones you hold? These are interesting avenues of thought for you today.",Acquarius
"May 9, 2022 - It isn't always easy to win the admiration you expect from your partner, Aquarius. But in this area today seems to be better than most. You're likely to be brimming with ideas for ways to enhance your most appealing qualities. But don't overdo it. Your efforts at physical or intellectual seduction are most effective when they're subtle.",Acquarius
"May 10, 2022 - The day ahead will be as busy as can be. Matters that had been left unsettled are now becoming urgent. Today brings an opportunity to release some steam, Aquarius, but it's also time to realize the toll these stressful situations take on your physical health. So set some time aside for relaxation, but not before you've resolved outstanding issues once and for all.",Acquarius
"May 11, 2022 - You don't suffer fools gladly, and superficial fools even less so. You have a mind to teach those around you a lesson. You're uncompromising today, and you can't understand why others don't have your same high standards. But are you truly as honest as you expect others to be? Remember that the quality of an artistic endeavor, in particular, is likely to be judged differently by each person who experiences it.",Acquarius
"May 12, 2022 - News of a possible raise could come your way today, Aquarius, possibly through some enterprise that you've been working on. You're feeling especially energetic, and therefore you could well be tempted to take on more than you usually would. This is fine, but remember to pace yourself. If you're going to continue on your current path, you'll need to save some energy for tomorrow and beyond!",Acquarius
"May 13, 2022 - You have acquired some sound confidence in yourself, Aquarius. Now it is time for you to show everyone else by actually putting it to use in your life. It's as though you have symbolically just completed an in-depth acting class. Well, now is the time to go on stage. Smile, remember your lines, and don't forget to bow when everyone applauds. You'll knock ‘em dead!",Acquarius
"May 14, 2022 - There is something in the air today pushing you toward change or renewal, Aquarius. Is it time to change your wardrobe or redecorate your home? If so, this is the day. If you have monetary restrictions, you'll find it just as fulfilling (and a whole lot cheaper) to simply rid your home of all the things that just aren't ""you"" anymore. Surround yourself with the things you love.",Acquarius
"May 15, 2022 - It's never very agreeable to have to question oneself, Aquarius, but this is the main objective of today's celestial aspect. You'll soon be launched into new adventures. Take advantage of the energy generated by this planetary configuration to look within and find the source of some of your failings. This isn't an easy exercise, to be sure, but it will do you some good. Just be honest with yourself.",Acquarius
"May 16, 2022 - Try not to get weighed down by emotions today, Aquarius, but give them the opportunity to have their time in the spotlight. You may find that there is a strong force working to cover up the truth of what you really feel. Make sure you express yourself openly and honestly. At the same time, you don't want be so overly dramatic that you blow things out of proportion.",Acquarius
"May 17, 2022 - You might have some strong hesitations during the day, Aquarius. You may have to cover up the truth or, on the contrary, say it out loud. If this is the case, say what's on your mind. You'll be supported by the current planetary positions, which will help you formulate your ideas in a way that won't shock people, and, in fact, might even sway them to your point of view.",Acquarius
"May 18, 2022 - Do you say yes every time someone asks for a favor, Aquarius? Is it sometimes hard to find time for yourself because you're so busy coming to the rescue of a friend or family member? Today's celestial energy asks you to think about you. Say no to your sister's tenth babysitting request in two weeks. Do absolutely nothing if that's what you wish. Take care of yourself before taking care of everyone else!",Acquarius
"May 19, 2022 - It might be hard to find the exact direction you're looking for today, Aquarius. It could be that there's a strong force urging you to slow down and be more practical with your energy. This may not be the advice you want to hear, but it probably is the advice you need to follow. Remember that the world doesn't revolve around you, regardless of how much you might like to think it does.",Acquarius
"May 20, 2022 - Chances are that there will be an emotional bite to the day that might put something of a hostile tone on anything you encounter, Aquarius. The key is to not get so fixed in your ways that you turn away from new experiences. You'll find that interaction with others is exactly what's needed in order to keep things in balance. The masculine and feminine sides of your being are coming together quite nicely.",Acquarius
"May 21, 2022 - Why not radically change the way you behave toward others, Aquarius? You're in the process of orienting yourself toward establishing relationships that are more solid and enriching, with far fewer risks involved. This wasn't the case before. When you don't try so hard to seduce and impress, your audience claps louder. Just be yourself, and gain approval.",Acquarius
"May 22, 2022 - Your courageous strength and desire to take a leadership role may be threatening to others today, Aquarius. Be careful of automatically assuming the dominant position before learning what other people feel about the situation. You could make some drastic mistakes if you don't watch out for the well-being of others. Things could get quite emotional, so beware of potential flare-ups.",Acquarius
"May 23, 2022 - Your romantic side is powerfully charged today, Aquarius. The more you tune into this side of your nature, the happier you'll be. One thing to watch out for, however, is that you keep at least one foot on the ground at all times. Make sure you have a stable platform of honesty and practicality from which to work. Without it, you'll be hard-pressed to take down walls and put in windows.",Acquarius
"May 24, 2022 - If you're looking for a new job, Aquarius, perhaps this is the day you find it. ""Lucky” is the word that sums up today! Without encouraging you to play the lottery, you can be pretty sure that you'll feel a surge of confidence. You'll be able to resolve big or small problems with practicality and ease. That's lucky enough, isn't it?",Acquarius
"May 25, 2022 - Things are apt to get intense for you today, Aquarius. There will be a lot of information coming your way, but it all won't necessarily be great. It seems that someone is putting a roadblock in your path, making it difficult for you to pass. Don't let this stop you. Use your creative ability and resolute nature to find ways around any obstacles. Experiences like this will only make you stronger.",Acquarius
"May 26, 2022 - Recent opposition standing in the way of long-term goals is apt to ease a bit today, Aquarius. Situations surrounding these issues should become clearer, and you should have a better idea of what exactly it is that you're up against. You'll find that this is a very climactic time for you in a great number of ways. You will now begin to reap the rewards of what you've sown.",Acquarius
"May 27, 2022 - The more attention you try to get from other people today, Aquarius, the more people are going to ignore your fancy displays and grandiose ideas. Take a much more sensitive approach. You'll be able to lead people better when you walk behind them. Earn the respect of others by understanding and relating to their emotions. Your heart is big and bold, and you have a great deal of love to give.",Acquarius
"May 28, 2022 - During the last few months, Aquarius, it could be that you've met some strange people who have greatly influenced your attitude about marriage or partnership. They've been pushing you to get more freedom into your life. If this is indeed the case, you can feel quite sure that they've come under a cosmic influence. That's no reason for you to agree. Freedom or lack of freedom is completely subjective.",Acquarius
"May 29, 2022 - There is power in your words today, Aquarius, along with a great deal of emotional self-confidence. Things may be moving rapidly, but you have the strength and swiftness of mind to keep up. You can seize great opportunities when you team up with others. While safely sheltering in place tends to limit your social contact, you can still proudly display your elegant attire by way of video or pics posted to social media.",Acquarius
"May 30, 2022 - You may feel a bit restless, Aquarius, because you feel something brewing but can't identify it yet. This energy is like a river rushing below while you stand on a bridge. The water is tempting, but you can't summon the courage to jump in. Don't feel like you have to be a part of everything. Extending the metaphor, maybe your destiny lies on the other side of the bridge and not in the river. You'll stay a lot drier that way.",Acquarius
"May 31, 2022 - You may feel like you're walking on burning coals today, Aquarius. Someone has also tossed you a flaming ball, and you need to figure out what to do with it. Use your fancy footwork and juggling skills to keep from searing your feet and hands as you think fast about your next move. Being stubborn gets you nowhere. The key is staying flexible and going with the flow, because the unexpected might actually work in your favor.",Acquarius
"Jun 1, 2022 - You might find yourself in the public eye at some point today, Aquarius. This is fine since you're looking and feeling great. You're likelier than usual to project warmth and friendliness to others. Acknowledgment for an artistic or creative activity could come your way. Whatever you start today is likely to succeed, whether it's a new artistic project, career, or romance. Enjoy.",Acquarius
"Jun 2, 2022 - Today you might feel especially idealistic regarding your relationships, Aquarius. You're likely to see those closest to you in their best light. Romantic partners may seem like characters from a fairy tale. This is a good time to move a love relationship to the next level of commitment, as long as you don't forget your partner's foibles. It's easy to love someone who seems perfect, but more realistic to love their faults as well.",Acquarius
"Jun 3, 2022 - Travel could be on your mind. You're probably excited about the possibility of a future vacation. You might need to finalize some arrangements today but find it difficult to reach people you need to speak to. This is frustrating, Aquarius, but it shouldn't lessen your enthusiasm. Keep trying. You'll eventually reach the appropriate person and finish whatever you're trying to accomplish. Hang in there.",Acquarius
"Jun 4, 2022 - You may have been looking forward to communicating or spending time with the people you care about today if possible, but circumstances beyond your control throw some unexpected obstacles in your way. Don't panic, Aquarius. If you're focused and objective, you can find a way to get around the obstacles and do what you want to do. If you're involved in creative projects, you might seem blocked today. This should pass by tomorrow.",Acquarius
"Jun 5, 2022 - Friends in creative fields might join forces with you today to start a new project that makes a difference to all of you, Aquarius. This could be planning something as mundane as a garden in a park or as exciting as a new rock band. If you've been thinking of moving in an artistic direction, this is the day to make plans. You're determined and focused and your inspiration and enthusiasm are high.",Acquarius
"Jun 6, 2022 - Your health is likely to be glowing and your physical energy high, Aquarius. You'll probably want to spend some of your time today working out or otherwise getting some exercise. This gets the endorphins going so you feel that much more motivated to pursue job-related or personal projects. Relations with others should be stimulating and jovial, although not deep or intimate. Sports or games could be especially appealing.",Acquarius
"Jun 7, 2022 - You should be feeling especially passionate today, Aquarius, so don't be surprised if you can't get sex and romance out of your mind. If you're currently involved, schedule an intimate evening with your lover, if possible. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if you pull someone new and exciting under your spell. Your passions could also spill into other parts of your life, including creative and intellectual interests. Make the most of it.",Acquarius
"Jun 8, 2022 - Generosity is one of your best qualities, Aquarius. You have the uncanny ability to give without expecting anything in return, and you gain a great deal of power and light from this generosity. With little effort, you could become one of those people who never expects things in return. You could become a ""saint"" in a very real way.",Acquarius
"Jun 9, 2022 - Perhaps your family is far away and you miss them a lot, Aquarius. You need to realize that you can count on your friends. They'll able to prove their love for you and show you that you're as important as the air they breathe. They'll also keep people from taking advantage of you on your journey toward the impossible.",Acquarius
"Jun 10, 2022 - You often need to thrive on personal emotions. Today will be no exception to the rule. For instance, you could try to captivate the attention of people you admire. The only problem is that they might not be receptive at first. Try to take your time. You will have other opportunities in the near future.",Acquarius
"Jun 11, 2022 - Your intuition is heightened almost to the point of telepathy today. Aquarius, you may be able to sense what others want and need even before they know it themselves. You could also experience a few visionary impressions that prove valuable inspiration for creative and artistic work. When images well up from your psyche, don't dismiss them as irrelevant. They could make a big difference in your life right now.",Acquarius
"Jun 12, 2022 - Today you might feel as if you're walking around in a daze, Aquarius, but it's a good daze. Your imagination and artistic abilities are sharp. Your intuition is especially attuned, and the thoughts and feelings of others are more apparent to you than they realize. You might feel unusually restless at some point and consider getting in a workout, or at least going for a walk. Do it. Get those endorphins flowing.",Acquarius
"Jun 13, 2022 - You love interacting with people others might consider eccentric. You can't help it. You're simply attracted to them. You will probably encounter one of these people today, Aquarius. But you might have a feeling of déjà vu. As strange as it may seem, it's possible that this person will be no one but you.",Acquarius
"Jun 14, 2022 - Today you should have a lot of vitality, Aquarius. Recently, you may have decided to take more matters into your own hands. Your relationships will only benefit from this decision. The conflicts you've had to deal with were generally based on a lack of understanding. You sometimes have to make compromises. Try not to be too demanding.",Acquarius
"Jun 15, 2022 - Today you should be feeling especially intuitive, particularly where family members are concerned, Aquarius. It certainly won't be easy for anyone to lie to you. You might also think about making some repairs to your home, which you may have been putting off. You might spend at least part of the day alone meditating or contemplating your future. Your mind is clear and active, so this is a good time to do it.",Acquarius
"Jun 16, 2022 - Career and business matters are likely to be very much on your mind today, Aquarius. Perhaps a new opportunity has come your way, or you're thinking of becoming involved in a new enterprise on your own or with a partner. This might not be a good day to make a decision, so don't rush it. Before you make any dramatic changes, think things through carefully. You may regret it otherwise.",Acquarius
"Jun 17, 2022 - You may be a little bit disappointed to find out that the people you think so highly of are in fact mere reflections of your own personality. The planetary alignment is trying to teach you to believe in yourself. You just lack confidence. After all, if they're admirable people, it's probably because they have great qualities - and you have them, too. Surprises are just around the corner.",Acquarius
"Jun 18, 2022 - Are you sure that other people wouldn't like you to be in another space than where you are right now, Aquarius, or even be a different person than the one you always thought you were? These questions are beginning to bother you. Devote some time to thinking about them. The answers you come up with won't be entirely meaningful for a few more weeks. Try looking at the essential things today.",Acquarius
"Jun 19, 2022 - You should make more of your own decisions, Aquarius. Don't let others have so much control over your life. When in a relationship, for example, you tend to let your partner dominate. You seem to no longer want to be in charge of any initiatives with regard to your joint life. Try to free yourself from this situation and take charge. You'll be a better and more valuable partner.",Acquarius
"Jun 20, 2022 - Other responsibilities could force you to postpone work on personal projects that mean a lot to you. This could be frustrating, Aquarius, and you're likely to want to sequester yourself with whatever you need to do and throw yourself into getting the problem resolved as soon as possible. You'll be able to do this as long as you don't let frustrations get the best of you. Don't sabotage your efforts.",Acquarius
"Jun 21, 2022 - This is a fantastic day for you, Aquarius. You'll have a great deal of physical power. Engage in activities that put this strength to good use. Tackle projects vigorously and feel free to speak up. Make sure that the whole world knows that you're handling every task. People would be unwise to cross you today, because you have a great deal of warrior energy and won't hesitate to strike back.",Acquarius
"Jun 22, 2022 - Don't be surprised if you run into a few emotional roadblocks today, Aquarius. People could be quite stubborn and difficult to deal with. You may exacerbate the situation by trying to get a rise out of someone with your boisterous attitude and dramatic flair. If your efforts don't yield positive results, back off. Keep your energy to yourself and share it another time when people are more in the mood to play.",Acquarius
"Jun 23, 2022 - This is a great day for you to get up on stage and make your presence known, Aquarius. Let people know that you're the leader of the pack. There is a great need for you to take the helm now, and you shouldn't back away from this responsibility. The warrior instinct inside you is probably strong, so don't hesitate for a second. Be brave and courageous in all situations.",Acquarius
"Jun 24, 2022 - More confirmation of career and business success could come your way today, Aquarius. You're probably feeling excited and motivated to keep pushing ahead. You might find, however, that increased responsibilities interfere with your social life and wonder if your friends have forgotten you. They haven't, but you'll feel better if you eke out a few hours for friends each week. Remember what they say about all work and no play.",Acquarius
"Jun 25, 2022 - Too many projects to complete might have you feeling just a little bit pressured, Aquarius. However, your innate determination is likely to drive you on to try to get it all done even if it seems impossible. Don't try to do it all yourself. Don't be afraid to ask for a little help. This might accomplish your ends without putting undue burdens on yourself.",Acquarius
"Jun 26, 2022 - Worries over money could have you edgier than usual, Aquarius. While you may be doing well, you still could be insecure and think your funds might not stretch far enough. Try to consider the situation objectively. You'll probably be relieved by what you find. Others' demands on your time might irritate you more than usual. The best way to escape this kind of tension is to go for a workout or walk.",Acquarius
"Jun 27, 2022 - There's a somewhat conservative air to your feelings today, Aquarius. You might be called on to get serious for a second and take care of business. This may not be a bad idea. Believe it or not, this grounded nature can help you move into a deeper relationship with someone special. Let your creative nature shine through and try to do more listening than talking. Make your dreams a reality.",Acquarius
"Jun 28, 2022 - The desire for travel might hit you today, perhaps to visit a friend who lives far away, and you could set the wheels in motion to make it happen at some point in the future. Socializing could take up your evening, if possible, and you might talk to some interesting people. A friend may need a sympathetic ear. As you're especially sensitive to others right now, you're prepared to hear a sad story. Otherwise, your day should go well, Aquarius.",Acquarius
"Jun 29, 2022 - You're going to get it all today, Aquarius. You may not be feeling especially powerful, and in fact, some around you may be trying to make you feel incompetent. Realize that this is a passing trend and you'll soon bounce back to your true self. Open your aperture up a little more than usual and let more light into your life. You can shoot some of the best shots today!",Acquarius
"Jun 30, 2022 - You may sense a nervous restlessness today that urges you to act, Aquarius. A journey to one place may have you bouncing off to another place that may lead you on an adventure to someplace completely different. It might seem like you're on some crazy scavenger hunt toward a pot of gold. The energy of the day may leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Persistence will eventually pay off.",Acquarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Aquarius. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius
"Jul 1, 2022 - Someone could be prodding you to take action today, Aquarius. It might be best if you beat them to it and motivate yourself. Stay a step or two ahead of the herd. Lead your own stampede and go wherever you want to go. It's quite likely that you'll run into conflict regarding issues about which you feel strongly. People are likely to be stubborn, so prepare yourself for a stalemate.",Acquarius
"Jul 2, 2022 - Jump back onstage and say your peace, Aquarius. Your active participation in the conversation of today is critical to maintaining a healthy energy flow. The things you say to others will have a profound effect, so choose your words carefully. Enjoy a physical activity that involves a group, if possible. Be an active participant in all the situations you encounter.",Acquarius
"Jul 3, 2022 - Suddenly things are coming to a head for you, Aquarius. The drama is escalating, and you aren't sure if you can remember all your lines. Take things one step at a time. Deal with the issues as they come. If you get ahead of yourself, you might be overwhelmed by what you fear will be a more daunting situation than you can handle. Don't sweat the small stuff.",Acquarius
"Jul 4, 2022 - Stop being an enabler to someone you care deeply about, Aquarius. It could be that you're helping to continue dangerous addictive behavior simply because you want to avoid a nasty confrontation. Realize that this is doing neither party any good. The more you perpetuate the lie, the more it will continue to hurt all parties involved. Be open and honest with your concerns.",Acquarius
"Jul 5, 2022 - Things might get a bit confusing for you today, Aquarius. Don't feel like you need to make sense of it all. In fact, this task may be impossible. Just be yourself. Let your creative nature shine through. Other people are quite malleable, and you should feel free to take the lead in just about any situation. Make sure, however, that you consider other people's needs.",Acquarius
"Jul 6, 2022 - You're at a dramatic climax in your monthly emotional cycle today, Aquarius. It's possible that you'll erupt like a volcano. Don't be ashamed of releasing these emotions. Your feminine and masculine natures are quite connected and they're working harmoniously in order to express themselves to the fullest. Open the gates of communication and let the stampede charge through.",Acquarius
"Jul 7, 2022 - You might come across strong opposition today from someone who seems to want to cut straight through to your heart, Aquarius. In reality, this is a message reminding you to think about things in terms of the collective - the oneness of us all. Be aware of a greater perspective in which you see more than just your side of the issue. Talk to people you trust before making any major decisions.",Acquarius
"Jul 8, 2022 - Unfortunately, this isn't a day for fun and games, Aquarius. In fact, you might feel an annoying emotional weightiness, making you feel less energetic than usual. There's a sober tone that's asking you to take a hard-nosed look at reality and make some decisions regarding goals and plans. You could feel like the timer buzzer is about to go off. The minute hand is ticking away and there are many more adventures in store.",Acquarius
"Jul 9, 2022 - Things should go extremely well for you today, Aquarius, so don't shy away from anything. In fact, take this opportunity to shine as brightly as you can.

There's a great deal of power behind your self-confidence, enabling you to tackle just about every job with energy.",Acquarius
"Jul 10, 2022 - Something is happening nearby, Aquarius, and you want to participate. You could feel like you have one foot in this world and one in another.

It will almost be like you can read each other's minds!",Acquarius
"Jul 11, 2022 - The fantasy world that you've built for yourself is a pleasure to behold, Aquarius. People frolic in your world and have a grand time. Your presence delights people with pleasure. Today, however, this world may be threatened by harsh realities coming in the form of electronic information. This force is powerful and apt to be quite erratic and spontaneous. Be prepared to stand your ground.",Acquarius
"Jul 12, 2022 - The clouds have finally lifted, and you should be able to see clearly again, Aquarius. The fire is burning red hot and you'll find people likely to stick up for themselves more than usual. You should do the same. Arguments could be especially heated today, and interesting facts and revolutionary information will be passed from person to person. Make sure you have your facts straight before you open your mouth.",Acquarius
"Jul 13, 2022 - Today you might spend a lot of time with the special person in your life if that’s possible, Aquarius. Romance and affection are definitely a powerful factor in the course of your day, but much of what might bring you closer together is conversation. You're likely to exchange information that interests you both about specific subjects and yourselves and future plans. A short journey might also take place. Enjoy your day!",Acquarius
"Jul 14, 2022 - Today, Aquarius, you could receive an affectionate, supportive letter or phone call from someone close to you. Communications with others should go smoothly, and intelligent conversations could well take place. A favorite author, musician, or actor could release a new book, album, or movie that you'll want to jump on right away. Or you might want to try your hand at such enterprises yourself. You do have the talent.",Acquarius
"Jul 15, 2022 - New opportunities may give you a chance to increase your financial standing and expand yourself professionally. Innovations that you've produced in the past have attracted the attention of those in positions of authority, Aquarius, and the fruits of your labor may manifest now. Don't expect to be able to relax and enjoy them, however, as a lot of effort still lies ahead. Summon all your inner resources and charge ahead.",Acquarius
"Jul 16, 2022 - If you were offered the opportunity to take a trip around the world, where you would see wonderful palaces and experience a timeless love affair, would you take it? The freedom would tempt you, without a doubt, but would it make you happy, Aquarius? Have you considered the possibility that you can create an environment here at home that gives you that same sense of freedom?",Acquarius
"Jul 17, 2022 - A new opportunity could come your way today, Aquarius. It might seem like a dream come true, the chance you've been waiting for, but you'll still want to think about it a bit. The reason is that it could well disrupt your life, including your romantic circumstances. Before you commit to anything, check the facts carefully to make sure it's as good as it seems. Either way, you'll be glad you did.",Acquarius
"Jul 18, 2022 - Aquarius, are you hoping to accomplish a goal that you've been working toward for a long time? Don't let delays cause you to fear that it will never happen.

Keep going. You'll get there!",Acquarius
"Jul 19, 2022 - Your incredible passion and creativity are taking center stage, Aquarius.

You have the power within you to shine especially bright on a day like today.",Acquarius
"Jul 20, 2022 - Today, Aquarius, matters surrounding business and finances need immediate attention, and this could prove a bit disheartening.

You might find that clearing up these old matters allows new opportunities to flow your way.",Acquarius
"Jul 21, 2022 - Things may roll along nicely in love and romance and then suddenly run into a snag, Aquarius. Perhaps you failed to recognize an important birthday or anniversary. Perhaps you were expected to act a certain way or do something you failed to do. Approach the person you hurt honestly and apologetically. You write your own rules. Your way may differ from someone else's, but that doesn't make it better or worse.",Acquarius
"Jul 22, 2022 - You may end up scaring people with your dramatic, emotional outbursts, Aquarius. Your behavior is likely to be erratic. The smallest things could set you off on a crazy tirade. The root of these issues probably has to do with a need to be loved, and you feel like others don't give you the attention you think you deserve. Try not to let your happiness depend so much on others' actions. The most important love is self-love.",Acquarius
"Jul 23, 2022 - Realize that you're the one responsible for cleaning up your own mess, Aquarius. If you've left your dirty clothes on the floor and the dishes unwashed, you will be the one who has to pay the consequences later on. Take responsibility for your actions. Today is an excellent day to do your laundry and clean the mess in the sink. You'll feel better about yourself and your immediate environment after you do.",Acquarius
"Jul 24, 2022 - Once your brain gets hooked on something, Aquarius, you're likely to take it to the extreme. Be careful of overworking yourself in a certain issue that requires a more rational, temperate attitude. You may get into trouble if you insist on going off the deep end. Don't tackle issues you aren't ready to handle. Take things slowly and maintain a moderate, conservative viewpoint. If you go too far, back off and take a break.",Acquarius
"Jul 25, 2022 - Unexpected information may be coming at you today from out of the blue, Aquarius. You'll find that this information is extremely important, so make sure to keep all lines of communication open.

Your creativity is at a monthly peak, and you'll find that, in general, your relationships with others will go extremely well.",Acquarius
"Jul 27, 2022 - There may be a great deal of conflict in your life today, Aquarius. Different people and situations seem to be pulling you in all directions. Your sanity is being put to the test. Try not to be too stubborn, because this will only cause more tension between you and the situation. You have the potential to stress out about the smallest things. Try to avoid this if you can.",Acquarius
"Jul 28, 2022 - Tune into the thoughts of others, Aquarius. Focusing only on yourself means you're missing the beauty and wisdom that come from other people. Respect their opinions the way you want them to respect yours. Your ego might get in the way of your brain until you embrace the lesson of sensitivity that it's trying to teach you. Take a back seat and let someone else do the talking.",Acquarius
"Jul 29, 2022 - Just when you think you have absolutely no energy left, you're able to kick into a higher gear. Push beyond your limits today, Aquarius. You'll find that you can achieve a great deal more than you thought. All you need to do is have confidence in yourself and try. You have a lot of dynamic power on your side. You will find that your strength is greater than ever.",Acquarius
"Jul 30, 2022 - You have a passionate nature, Aquarius. Sometimes it's difficult for you when other people don't share your exuberance. This is a good time to tone things down a notch. There's some tension in the air, and your enthusiasm only serves to annoy rather than charm, as it usually does. Don't pout. It's only temporary. Tomorrow you'll be the center of attention again and bestowing hugs and kisses to all.",Acquarius
"Jul 31, 2022 - Whether you acknowledge it or not, Aquarius, creation is the central theme of your life. If you aren't an artist or writer, you should be. There are plenty of creative ideas in your head clamoring to be expressed. Why not give it a try? You have nothing to lose, and you may be astonished by what you're able to produce. Your brain does have two sides. It's time to use both.",Acquarius
"Aug 1, 2022 - Cool your jets today, Aquarius. This is a good time to stop and focus on you. Make sure to give your body the respect it deserves. Make sure you're fostering the kind of character you wish to become. Base your self-image on something internal rather than an external craving for attention from others. Your true beauty lies within.",Acquarius
"Aug 2, 2022 - You probably should settle down a bit today in the love and romance department, Aquarius. Realize that your relationships with others aren't a show or stage act to perform. This is a day when you should listen to feedback from your partner and think about restructuring certain elements of your relationship in order to make things flow more smoothly.",Acquarius
"Aug 3, 2022 - Things are sporadic today, Aquarius. You may find a thousand things on your plate, and all of them look delicious. There's a great deal of wind to fuel your fire, so let it burn red hot. You might get caught up in a frenzy of activity. Have a good time but realize that it might not last forever. The royal carriage is likely to turn back into a pumpkin at some point.",Acquarius
"Aug 4, 2022 - Career responsibilities may require a temporary separation from a love partner today, Aquarius. This is apt to be upsetting and rather disheartening, but there's likely nothing you can do about it except work as quickly as you can so that you can finish and get back to your partner. Make sure your friend knows what's going on. You don't want to cause any more upset.",Acquarius
"Aug 5, 2022 - You may be having a difficult time getting your opinions across to others, Aquarius. For some, your ideas may seem too self-centered. For others, you may come across as insensitive to the situation. Do your best to understand what others are telling you. Don't be surprised if you don't receive the loving strokes that you feel you deserve. This is a day for you to observe and learn.",Acquarius
"Aug 6, 2022 - Review your day as you watch the sunset and observe the clouds turning from white to purple, Aquarius. Make sure that your head is in tune with your heart. Think about the day's emotions and thought patterns and how they affected your actions. Determine if your actions were a result of either your rational mind or fluctuating moods.",Acquarius
"Aug 7, 2022 - If you're single, you could feel a very powerful attraction to someone unusual and perhaps a little wacky. If you're already in a relationship, you could glimpse a silly and rather insane side of your beloved you've never seen before. This could be a bit disconcerting but also make you laugh. That's part of the appeal of love - continuously learning about that special one.",Acquarius
"Aug 8, 2022 - This could be a challenging day, Aquarius. You might receive a call that brings disconcerting news, making you angry or upset. You could be tempted to take it out on the caller, but don't. He or she is just the messenger. Short trips in the neighborhood could find you in impossible traffic. If you have to go out today, you might reach your destination more quickly by walking.",Acquarius
"Aug 9, 2022 - A group with which you're affiliated may be temporarily torn apart by quarrels among its members, Aquarius. It's best to stay out of it.

This could be a frustrating day for you, and one best spent concentrating on projects. All will be better tomorrow.",Acquarius
"Aug 10, 2022 - Your telepathy and intuition are at an all-time high today, Aquarius. You should find it easier than usual to tune in to others' thoughts and feelings. It might be a good idea to control your reactions. Don't tell others what you're picking up unless you're sure they want to know. Your imagination and creative abilities are also operating at a very high level. Make the most of them.",Acquarius
"Aug 11, 2022 - A small social event or group rally could put you in touch with some new, exciting people in interesting fields, Aquarius. You might run into an old friend you haven't seen in ages. If you aren't romantically involved, an attractive new person could arrive on the scene. This promises to be an exciting, stimulating day. Don't be surprised if new doors to a great future open for you.",Acquarius
"Aug 12, 2022 - A friend who lives far away might call or email you today, Aquarius. Your friend may be planning to visit your area and want to get together with you.

"Aug 14, 2022 - This is a terrific time to start some physical activity that takes you outside and gets your blood pumping, Aquarius. Don't think this means you have to become the star player at a tennis club. A simple walk around the block every morning may be all you need to feel a boost in physical and mental energy. Also note the clarity of mind that comes when you get your body moving.",Acquarius
"Aug 15, 2022 - Dare to be different, Aquarius. It's easy to fall into routines - sleep and eat at the same time, wear the same style, and do your work the same way every day. Before you know it, you're in a rut. The only way to pull out of it is to decide to break free. Try a new hairstyle. Wear colors that are new for you. If the rut is really deep, consider a new career. Expand your horizons.",Acquarius

Even if you have to work today, there's always the evening to enjoy.",Acquarius
"Aug 17, 2022 - You might find that someone close to you needs a hand today, Aquarius. They could be too proud to ask for help. Don't let that stop you.

Your efforts will be appreciated, and you'll feel good about making a difference.",Acquarius
"Aug 18, 2022 - Aquarius, you'll probably find that you have a ton of energy to put into all kinds of activities.

You'll need a place for all that energy to go and quiet activities won't cut it today.",Acquarius
"Aug 19, 2022 - Step out of your usual role, Aquarius. Doing this every now and then can add knowledge and expand your life. The day's planetary aspects favor such growth.

See what you can discover about yourself and the world.",Acquarius

Your good luck will pull you safely through.",Acquarius
"Aug 23, 2022 - Today your physical and mental energy should be operating at a very high level, Aquarius. You probably won't spend much time inside if you can avoid it.

This is a great day to enjoy the evening, perhaps watching an online concert, play, or movie. Have a great day.",Acquarius
"Aug 24, 2022 - Money matters could prove obsessive today, Aquarius, as you might be trying to make an important purchase and need to revise your budget in order to do so. You'll be able to do it if you calm down and don't stress out. Be logical and methodical, and you'll probably accomplish what you want without too much frustration. Tonight, schedule a special date with a lover, if possible.",Acquarius
"Aug 25, 2022 - You may run into some tension today as fantasy gets in the way of your plan of attack, Aquarius. Keep in mind that things are moving rapidly these days, and the slightest movement is magnified. Don't try to undo things that can't be undone. Accept your mistakes and move on. There's a whole world for you to explore and conquer, so try not to get trapped in your own little box.",Acquarius
"Aug 26, 2022 - The wind is blowing briskly today, Aquarius, helping you keep your internal fire burning bright. You'll be a social butterfly today. Your energy may be scattered, but this can actually work to your advantage. Picking up tidbits of information and hints from different places and people will help you integrate your energy with your environment. Capitalize on this exciting energy.",Acquarius
"Aug 27, 2022 - People often see you as shy and reserved, Aquarius, but of course you know that you're really very friendly once you relax. Today you find it unusually easy to interact with others. In fact, you feel downright gregarious as you chat and joke along with the best of them. This new, sociable you does wonders for your image. You've needed to loosen up for some time.",Acquarius
"Aug 28, 2022 - A friend who planned to stop by tonight might not show up, Aquarius. You may worry since this person isn't one to blow you off. Don't imagine accidents or disasters. The culprit's probably traffic. Phone your friend. If you don't reach him or her, leave a message to call you. Your friend is probably fine, but you may have to postpone your visit for another day.",Acquarius
"Aug 29, 2022 - Peace reigns in the home today. Members of your household could communicate with each other almost telepathically, Aquarius. You might find it strange, but it shouldn't be surprising. After all, they've been living together for a while! It's good for peace in the home. They can sense and avoid whatever irritates someone else. That should give you some welcome breathing space.",Acquarius
"Aug 30, 2022 - Your aggressive nature is strong today, so be careful, Aquarius. Even though this may be good for getting things done and tackling any project you need to complete, the problem is that you might tend to step on other people's toes in the process. Be considerate of others' emotions and try not to get upset if someone else takes the spotlight for a while.",Acquarius
"Aug 31, 2022 - Your self-confidence may be a bit low and you could doubt your abilities right now, Aquarius. Don't get depressed or disheartened. Your skills are excellent. Try to look at your situation objectively and pinpoint why you aren't progressing in your career as rapidly as you'd hoped. You may be worried about money but know that everything will work out in the end.",Acquarius
"Sep 1, 2022 - There may be some conflict today, Aquarius, especially in the morning. Your general mood is quite good, but there's a strong force asking you to be more realistic in your approach. The last thing you want is for someone else to throw a bucket of water on your raging fire of fun, but this is likely to happen unless you address the reality of the situation.",Acquarius
"Sep 2, 2022 - Emotional turmoil on the job could stress you out way too much. Headaches or temporary hypertension could plague you if you aren't careful. Don't push too hard. Remember to take breaks, Aquarius, and go for a walk on your lunch hour. Don't be afraid to put off nonessential tasks. You'll be all right. Why make a day's work any more difficult than it needs to be?",Acquarius
"Sep 3, 2022 - Upsets in the home or neighborhood could lead to a sudden decision to move, causing a great deal of activity. You might not yet be sure where you're going. Organization and discipline are vital at times like this, Aquarius. It might be helpful to make lists and cross off each task as you finish it. Don't panic. This could turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you.",Acquarius
"Sep 4, 2022 - Flamboyant shows of emotions may not be as welcome as usual today, Aquarius. Realize that you may need to put a damper on things in order to earn the respect of the people around you. Tone it down and understand the importance of grounding and stability. Strong forces could bring you down to this level whether you want them to or not, so why bother trying to resist?",Acquarius
"Sep 5, 2022 - Creative inspiration could come from either your own past or from history, Aquarius. You might want to try painting, music, or poetry, but today it's more likely that you'll turn that inspiration toward your home.

"Sep 6, 2022 - A welcome communication from a business or romantic partner could arrive today, Aquarius. This could generate a lot of enthusiasm on both your parts and do wonders for your relationship or for whatever business you do together. Be honest with your partner. Don't conceal your concerns. It's better to get things out in the open. Don't worry. Everything will be OK!",Acquarius
"Sep 7, 2022 - Career interests may be short-circuited by gossip, rumor, and office politics. Someone has an agenda and isn't likely to care too much about the effect on others' lives of any underhanded dealings. If you hear about such goings-on, Aquarius, do what you can to stop them before they get out of hand. That way you can protect your and your colleagues' career interests.",Acquarius
"Sep 8, 2022 - There could be people who try to convince you that you're wrong about something, Aquarius. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're inferior just because you don't agree with someone on an issue. Focus on your creativity today. You can combine your incredible artistic talent with pure intellectual genius for a dynamite swing that will knock any ball clear out of the park.",Acquarius
"Sep 9, 2022 - Too much indulging may leave you with a headache or stomachache to the point where you may want to spend most of today sleeping. The stress of this condition could cause you to snap at family members but remember that they weren't the ones who chose to overindulge. Chill out, get some rest, and regain your strength. You'll be back in the real world soon enough.",Acquarius
"Sep 10, 2022 - You're focused and attentive to detail. Some longstanding projects benefit from this sudden spurt of energy and get completed in record time. Children figure prominently in your life right now, Aquarius. Is there one child in particular who needs some extra attention from you? Your love and support mean a lot more than you realize.",Acquarius
"Sep 11, 2022 - You might find yourself thinking about a possible future vacation. You've worked hard during the last few months and feel you deserve a break.

You should feel closer to your loved ones and optimistic about the future. Enjoy!",Acquarius
"Sep 12, 2022 - A household member might toy with the idea of moving out or going away for a while, Aquarius. This could stress you out, but don't make yourself crazy. Don't try to talk him or her out of it. Listen sympathetically and let your relative get it out of their system. This person is probably feeling temporarily restricted by forces outside the home and isn't really likely to go anywhere.",Acquarius
"Sep 13, 2022 - New beginnings and promising new opportunities may appear from a distant state or foreign country, Aquarius. Your adventurous side is excited and enthusiastic, but the side of you that wants to stay settled could put up some resistance. Don't feel you have to jump into anything. Get all the facts and assess the situation objectively. Think seriously about it all. What do you most want?",Acquarius
"Sep 14, 2022 - You'll enjoy a day of high spirits and friendly interactions. The energy of the day is in your favor, although it may not seem like it. Your emotions may become cloudy and it might seem like people are working against you. Although this may be true to some extent, realize that much of this paranoia comes more from your emotional insecurity than another's plot against you.",Acquarius
"Sep 15, 2022 - You might find the mood of today a bit too somber for your liking, Aquarius. Why is everyone so serious? Whether you figure out the answer or not, just know that it probably isn't something you did. Emotions that have been building up are likely to express themselves now, much like a volcano bursting under the pressure of tons of molten lava.",Acquarius
"Sep 16, 2022 - Daydreams and reveries could inspire new ideas for creative projects today. Visions, stories, or melodies might flood your mind, and it might be a good idea to write them down before they disappear. You're also likely to feel more attuned than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others. Don't be surprised if you intuitively give people what they want and need before they ask.",Acquarius
"Sep 17, 2022 - Romance continues to soar today, Aquarius. You should feel especially sexy. You're likely to attract admiring glances from those around you, including strangers.

Schedule an intimate evening together, if possible, and make the most of it!",Acquarius
"Sep 18, 2022 - Idealistic romantic notions join with intense sensual passion to create powerful desire that stays with you throughout the day, Aquarius.

In the meantime, pamper yourself a bit until then and hang in there!",Acquarius
"Sep 19, 2022 - Today may be filled with sudden changes and unexpected events, Aquarius. The energy is electric and strong. People will act in erratic, powerful bursts. Try to stay centered and maintain your focus. Keep in mind that if you need to break free from certain limitations, now is the time to make that move. Have confidence in your actions and make it happen.",Acquarius
"Sep 20, 2022 - Love and romance aren't just part of your life today, Aquarius, they're your whole life. If you're single, an exciting potential partner could have you reeling. If you're currently involved, recent events may have created such a powerful bond between you and your beloved that you think it will never end. Consider what led to this feeling and find a way to repeat it. This can only benefit you.",Acquarius
"Sep 21, 2022 - Too many people could be vying for your attention today, Aquarius. All of them want advice or help. This could be flattering, and you'll probably want to help them, but it can also be unsettling and make it hard to focus. Don't let this set your temper on edge and cause you to snap at your friends. Take each request one at a time, make no promises, and do your best.",Acquarius
"Sep 22, 2022 - You're feeling your power and strength today, Aquarius. You've worked hard to get into good physical shape.

Enjoy this special time.",Acquarius
"Sep 23, 2022 - A current or potential love relationship could hit a snag as you have a clash of wills. If either of you is stubborn, this could turn into an unpleasant power struggle. Try to work out a course of action that creates a win/win situation, so neither of you feels compromised. In this way, the development of your relationship will progress rather than regress.",Acquarius
"Sep 24, 2022 - Have you made plans to have a romantic interest come to your home, Aquarius? If so, don't rush to get ready. Your friend is probably going to be late. Events beyond anyone's control have interfered, and you might have to wait. Don't make yourself crazy over it. Don't imagine all kinds of horrible scenarios. Your friend will show up even if later than planned. Have fun!",Acquarius
"Sep 25, 2022 - No pressure, Aquarius, but as things are now, you might want to evaluate your career. Is it working out well? What are your latest achievements? What goals haven't been reached? If the answers aren't satisfactory, it's time to make some dramatic changes. If your work doesn't make your heart sing, it's time to find some that does. Life isn't a dress rehearsal. Get going!",Acquarius
"Sep 26, 2022 - If you're single, Aquarius, today you could fall in love at first sight. A friend could send you someone’s contact information who shares your interests and with whom you'll talk for hours. This could make you feel happy. You'll certainly enjoy your day. If you want to stay in touch, don't be afraid to say so. Otherwise, you might lose track of your new friend.",Acquarius
"Sep 27, 2022 - All the positive energy generated by the celestial atmosphere seems to come together today as you experience a rush of sensual passion for a romantic partner, Aquarius. An unexpected encounter could not only fulfill this desire but also bring you closer. If you aren't already committed, expect to discuss it tonight. Be careful to exercise restraint. Your lover could panic if you push too hard.",Acquarius
"Sep 28, 2022 - Too many people may be making demands on your time right now, Aquarius. Some may have genuine concerns and need your assistance, but others have definite agendas that they really should deal with on their own. Use your intuition to tell the difference because you won't be able to help them all. A female friend might have the most urgent need. If you can only help one, help her.",Acquarius
"Sep 29, 2022 - Perhaps you spent quite a bit of money lately and you're holding your breath waiting for the bills to roll in. Some quick reckoning of receipts today likely yields some wonderful news. Wonder of wonders, it appears you've stayed within your budget, Aquarius! Try not to overreact to the news that you have more money than you thought. Give your wallet and checkbook some time off.",Acquarius
"Sep 30, 2022 - With all the conversations you've had lately, Aquarius, it's likely that you've talked with some people in the healing professions. These doctors, nurses, and technicians could be useful to you later. Be sure to file their contact information away for future reference. On another front, expect to receive some good news concerning your finances.",Acquarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Aquarius. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius
"Oct 1, 2022 - Are you technically single but very deeply involved with someone, Aquarius? If so, don't be surprised if today you extend or receive a proposal of marriage. Recent events have brought you very close together and greatly intensified the bond between you. Your partner may want to legalize that bond. Do you? If there is even the smallest doubt, give yourself some time to think. Acting on impulse isn't a good idea right now.",Acquarius
"Oct 2, 2022 - Move forward with your plan of attack today, Aquarius. There's an anxious rumble within you that's urging you to get going with a current plan. You have all the facts you need, so don't hesitate any longer. The power of the word is with you. You will be smooth, collected, and confident even in the most nerve-wracking situations. Words will flow off your tongue with ease.",Acquarius
"Oct 3, 2022 - You could feel like a rat in a maze today, Aquarius. Walls and long, narrow corridors take you around corners and through doorways, yet there's no indication that you're going in the right direction. Instead of wandering aimlessly, stop and ask for help. You might not have noticed that if you look up, there are knowledgeable beings there who are willing to give you advice based on their lofty perspective.",Acquarius
"Oct 4, 2022 - Your mind may wander to a fantasyland full of castles, wizards, and magic dragons today, Aquarius. You could find that you're putting yourself in the robes of a beautiful or handsome figure in a tall tower who's waiting for the perfect mate to come along. Observe the fanciful scenario you've created and see how the symbols and characters connect with your real life. Your imagination is trying to tell you something.",Acquarius
"Oct 5, 2022 - A minor accident might take place at home today, Aquarius, but don't worry. It will ultimately provoke more laughter than harm. You will want the place to look great, Aquarius, because a close friend or lover could come to visit. An intimate conversation or passionate encounter is indicated. Curb the temptation to indulge in too much food or drink.",Acquarius
"Oct 6, 2022 - A creative project that you've been working on may be coming to a climactic peak now, Aquarius. Discuss your progress with others and feel free to hold an informal critique in order to get honest feedback on your work. A piece of art should stir some sort of reaction inside another person. Consider ways in which you can challenge the people around you with your talent.",Acquarius
"Oct 7, 2022 - It could be that you're trying to communicate with someone in a matter regarding love and romance and it simply isn't working. You're apt to feel like you need a translator in order to get your message across. Both you and your partner need to share responsibility for making sure that the lines of communication remain open. Be practical yet sensitive in your approach.",Acquarius
"Oct 8, 2022 - Connect with those who carry you upward and encourage your fantasies today instead of those who try to bring you down to reality, Aquarius. There's a need for you to shine more brightly than usual, and there's no reason why this wish shouldn't be granted. Everything will work out splendidly for you as long as you align yourself with admirable people and noble causes, so go for it.",Acquarius
"Oct 9, 2022 - There's a deep longing to be comforted and reassured, Aquarius. You may want nothing more than for someone fix you some warm, homemade soup. If this is the case, feel free to call and ask a good friend to come over, if possible. Don't continue to play the part of the strong, independent one if this isn't the way you feel. If you aren't honest about your needs, it will be impossible for anyone to know how to fulfill them.",Acquarius
"Oct 10, 2022 - A temporary separation from your romantic partner could have you agitated, Aquarius. Are you worried that your friend has forgotten you? This is probably an overreaction, but your insecurities are getting the better of you. Find a distraction. Have faith. Phone calls from your friend should prove reassuring. Perhaps the only way to get past this is to stay busy until your partner returns.",Acquarius
"Oct 11, 2022 - A virtual group meeting or social event could bring up so many new and interesting ideas that you may not be able to digest them all, Aquarius. Some new friends who share your interests might want to continue the discussions. Your mind is especially quick today. You could well grasp unusual concepts that usually don't interest you. But watch your step - you might be so preoccupied that you could have an accident.",Acquarius
"Oct 12, 2022 - Today you could talk to some interesting new people, Aquarius. Among them is at least one person who shares a lot of your interests and could become a close friend. The joy you receive from communicating with these people is likely to spill over into the rest of your day. You could be warmer and more congenial with everyone else in your life, too. In the evening, have some fun.",Acquarius
"Oct 13, 2022 - Today you might pinch yourself to see if what you're experiencing is real, Aquarius. Success and good fortune are coming thick and fast, with only minor setbacks and irritations to complicate matters. Business, money, and career success are likely to be at an all-time high, although you might find yourself feeling a little fearful of what comes next. Don't worry about that. Go with the flow.",Acquarius
"Oct 14, 2022 - Do you feel a little under the weather today, Aquarius? It's quite possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from such storms. As you know, the work itself isn't what gets you down. It's worry about the future that drains your energy. Give yourself a break today. Take some time for rest and recuperation.",Acquarius
"Oct 15, 2022 - Your intuitive abilities should be operating at a very high level today, Aquarius. You might inadvertently receive some positive psychic messages about your future, and this could prove very exciting. These insights could be a source of inspiration that propels you to accomplish wonders in some aspect of your life. This could turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy! Make the most of it.",Acquarius
"Oct 16, 2022 - This is a good time to take control of the situation, Aquarius. You've done your preparation and now it's time to put it to good use. You're about to face your enemy eye to eye. Have confidence in your training. There's an extra alertness to you that helps you fight any battles. You have a strong awareness of the energy around you, so use this to your advantage.",Acquarius
"Oct 17, 2022 - There's a great deal of power to your words today, Aquarius, so be careful how you use them. You may end up manipulating another's choices if you aren't careful with your conduct. Make sure you give others the freedom and empowerment to decide things for themselves. Be open and honest about all the facts that might influence their decisions in any way.",Acquarius
"Oct 18, 2022 - Try to rise above the potential tension and rough spots of the day, Aquarius. Do yourself a favor and don't feel like you have to stoop to another's level. Take pride in your actions and do things with confidence. Work with the negativity. The worst thing to do would be to ignore it. Approach problems squarely as soon as they arise. Don't dredge up the past. It's time to move forward.",Acquarius
"Oct 19, 2022 - It may be hard to connect with others today, Aquarius. People may be rather indecisive. On the other hand, people are apt to be more malleable. This could be a good time to take charge. Be sure that you keep in mind the best interests of all parties involved. It isn't fair for you to take advantage of people who can't make up their own minds about something.",Acquarius
"Oct 20, 2022 - Remember that you can only remain in charge as long as the others around you support your personality and leadership abilities, Aquarius. Avoid mutiny by taking care of the people in your world instead of simply trying to run their lives. Gain respect with kind words and a sensitive attitude rather than by enforcing harsh rules and regulations that restrict and aggravate.",Acquarius
"Oct 21, 2022 - Your optimism will be inspiring today, Aquarius. You will find that your lighthearted approach is perfectly suited to taking care of any issue that arises. Toss a few jokes into the mix and remind other people that it isn't necessary to take things so seriously. The sun is shining as you proudly parade down the street with your head held high.",Acquarius
"Oct 22, 2022 - Pressures on the job may be mounting. You might feel so disgruntled that you want to chuck it all and run away. Foreign countries and distant states may suddenly seem far more appealing than usual. Maybe it's a good idea to plan a future vacation, Aquarius. The stresses you've been experiencing could adversely affect your health. You need to release them somehow. Give it some thought.",Acquarius
"Oct 23, 2022 - Did you wake up this morning with a vague recollection of a half-remembered dream bugging you? If so, it won't do any good to try to pull it up. Perhaps you aren't meant to remember the entire thing, in which case you should try analyzing the little bit you do remember. Perhaps it will come to you when something reminds you later. Don't let it drive you crazy. It's only a dream, after all.",Acquarius
"Oct 24, 2022 - The unexpected need to take a journey by air or spend a lot of time working could bring about an inconvenient separation from your partner. While the reasons for this situation and the projected outcome are very positive, it can cause a temporary upset in your relationship. Don't worry about it. The upset will pass, particularly when the desired results are attained. Concentrate on the matter at hand.",Acquarius
"Oct 25, 2022 - You tend to be pretty self-assured, Aquarius, but self-esteem issues dating from long ago could surface today. You might feel like a schoolchild called on to recite. This could cause a few snags in your relationships or interfere with your effectiveness at social occasions. Try to remain objective. Don't lose sight of who you are. Don't let old insecurity interfere with your effectiveness.",Acquarius
"Oct 26, 2022 - You and someone close could disagree on an issue that both of you feel strongly about. Stubborn pride on both your parts could keep you from working things out. Let it go, Aquarius. It isn't worth ruining your relationship. Someone you know might be headed for divorce or moving away, and the news could be a shock to you. This should be a day of surprises - not all of them pleasant.",Acquarius
"Oct 27, 2022 - Glowing health and an enthusiastic attitude make almost anything a pleasure today, Aquarius. Relations with friends and family are warm, congenial, and cooperative. Your day should go as smoothly as you could expect. There is something you want to do in the afternoon that you're looking forward to. In the evening, consider attending an online class, lecture, or workshop. Your mind is especially sharp right now.",Acquarius
"Oct 28, 2022 - A temporary lack of belief in your abilities might have you hesitating to start a project or take on a task that you'd normally snap up. This could involve something you've wanted to try or helping someone else. Your faith in yourself should never flag, but if it does, it's important to remember that hard work can be as important as talent - and you aren't afraid of that!",Acquarius
"Oct 29, 2022 - Has a certain project been a drag for you lately, Aquarius? Don't be surprised if today you get your second wind. You're looking at your tasks in a practical manner, your interest in them is up, and you're able to accomplish them quickly and efficiently with minimal stress. Relationships should also be going well. Make the most of this while you can!",Acquarius
"Oct 30, 2022 - If you find that you aren't necessarily thinking like the rest of the group, don't panic, Aquarius. In fact, this is probably a good thing. By going along with the crowd, you may be expected to act a certain way in some situations. Pretty soon you're living like a marionette strung up to a couple of sticks and manipulated by an unknown hand. Think for yourself.",Acquarius
"Oct 31, 2022 - This is one of those days when you just can't wait for someone to stop talking so you can say something, Aquarius. It's likely you won't even wait. Don't be surprised if friction results from such strongly held opposing views. People could blow things out of proportion, since everyone is convinced that they are right. The interesting thing about this situation is that it could result in a productive time.",Acquarius
"Nov 1, 2022 - Will you go out with me? Be careful if a person says yes when you ask that question today, Aquarius. You could take the nature of this situation to the extreme. Saying yes doesn't mean you're suddenly in charge of his or her life. Nor are you responsible for anything that person does or how they feel. If you're still asking the question without getting any positive responses, don't worry. Keep trying.",Acquarius
"Nov 2, 2022 - You could feel extremely passionate today, Aquarius. You might want to connect with a love partner but be prevented by circumstances. You might be attracted to racier novels or movies. Repressed anger could bubble up from your subconscious and seek an outlet. This is a great day to channel that anger into some artistic activity. Don't be surprised if you use a lot of red!",Acquarius
"Nov 3, 2022 - Sometimes your relationships are like magnets, Aquarius. When you want to get close, the other person tries to get away from you. When you take a step back, he or she runs back into your life. Human nature is complex. Right now, you're probably taking a step back, although you haven't given up completely. This rest will give you time to think about which side of you is the most magnetic.",Acquarius
"Nov 4, 2022 - You're likely to enjoy today's change of tone, Aquarius. Don't you feel a need to take friendships beyond the superficial level? Perhaps you should reestablish contact with some former friends, too, although you may find that you have some bonds to repair. In any case, you can expect another month devoted to sweeping the cobwebs out of your emotional universe in order to let in sunlight and promise.",Acquarius
"Nov 5, 2022 - If you became an animal today, you'd be a puppy, Aquarius, all frisky and affectionate. By all means, put your passion to good use! Surprise a special someone with a home-cooked meal. Set a table in front of the fireplace, light candles, pour the wine, and let nature take its course. You need not bother to plan a dessert. There's wonderful energy flowing between you. The sparks will fly!",Acquarius
"Nov 6, 2022 - You may have your mind set on some big plans that you've been working on for some time now, Aquarius. The problem is that today there is some conflict with something or someone with a large ego who suddenly wants a piece of the pie. Either that or this person wants to burst your bubble. Don't give up hope on your dreams. Realize that this opposition is just part of the adventure.",Acquarius
"Nov 7, 2022 - Some differences of opinion concerning your love life are likely to come up today, Aquarius. For example, you may find your beloved taking more liberties than you allow yourself. Take your irritation as a sign that this particular relationship could use some freshening up. The day ahead may bring you just what you seek.",Acquarius
"Nov 8, 2022 - A longing for comfort and the small, simple pleasures in life is likely to cripple your initiative today, Aquarius. Have you decided to withdraw from the career world for the time being? Or perhaps you're just discouraged by the lack of enthusiasm in your colleagues. In any case, this would be a good day to stay home and rest, Aquarius.",Acquarius
"Nov 9, 2022 - Although your current mood is somewhat reserved and modest, you probably feel tempted to strut your stuff every once in a while. However, if you try to show off today, Aquarius, you may not be very pleased with your reception. It's natural for you to want to impress people, but you must try to do it with genuine qualities and simplicity. That's true good taste!",Acquarius
"Nov 10, 2022 - This will be a great day for you, Aquarius. Everything you touch will seem to turn to gold. The day's events will fall right into place. You will take pleasure in being calm and efficient. But what you may not realize is that this could happen every day. Take the time to see what's going right today in order to make it happen again tomorrow!",Acquarius
"Nov 11, 2022 - You shouldn't have any problem getting your way in most areas of life, Aquarius. The time is ripe for you to take the lead. Unfortunately, there may be one important part of your life that isn't going exactly to plan, and this is love and romance. It's likely that you will run into a tremendously stubborn attitude that you can't seem to break through. It could be your own.",Acquarius
"Nov 12, 2022 - There's a lot of tension in the air today, Aquarius. Perhaps you feel like no one is listening to you, and that people are draining your energy. You may act defensively and even occasionally become very angry. It's possible that no one has seen in you in such a state before. Don't be afraid to express your anger. Repressed anger is like poison for your body and soul.",Acquarius
"Nov 13, 2022 - Today you're likely to feel like the powerful creature you are, Aquarius. Your physical energy is high, and you look and feel great. Your intellect is sharp, so if you indulge in any kind of learning process, you will benefit greatly. Your creative energy is also high, so it's a good day to work on artistic projects. In the evening, you will feel especially romantic, so plan an intimate encounter with a special someone!",Acquarius
"Nov 14, 2022 - Social events with artistically or spiritually inclined people could have you feeling especially inspired, Aquarius, and looking forward to the future in whatever discipline interests you. You're also likely to be feeling especially romantic and sexy. You will want to schedule time alone with that special someone in your life. If you aren't currently involved, you could meet someone special today.",Acquarius
"Nov 15, 2022 - Today should present a very positive influence for you, Aquarius. The energy at play will allow for such things as making excellent decisions. Things will go more quickly than usual. Cooperation from colleagues, physical energy, and a sharp mind will support you. What more could you ask? You may find that almost everything goes your way and laughter fills the hours. Give yourself a pat on the back because you should be able to handle everything.",Acquarius
"Nov 16, 2022 - It may be time to look at where you are in life, Aquarius. Are you where you thought you'd be? If so, congratulations. This is a real accomplishment. If not, take heart. Many people discover that they aren't anywhere close. The key is to write down solid goals and the steps needed to reach them. It's your life after all. Mapping out your route is up to you.",Acquarius
"Nov 17, 2022 - Things have probably been going well lately in the love and romance department, Aquarius. You find that communication has improved, and the witty banter is invigorating and educational. Today there may be a blip on the radar. You may have been so caught up in the good parts that you failed to take care of the details and do the actual work needed to make things run smoothly.",Acquarius
"Nov 18, 2022 - If the world collapsed today, you wouldn't bat an eyelash. You're perfectly content sailing along on cloud nine! The source of your bliss could be that new person in your life. Are you passionately, intensely, wonderfully in love? You can yield to the magic. Let it bring out the positive parts of your personality but keep your wits about you all the same!",Acquarius
"Nov 19, 2022 - A partner for life or a brief encounter, which will it be? This is today's question. Why not choose both? Can you imagine being your partner's lover while keeping your independence? Don't be influenced by old models that force you to choose between these two ideas. Don't forget that in our modern world, your choices aren't as limited as you might think!",Acquarius
"Nov 20, 2022 - Your scattered energy comes together today in a powerful laser beam of concentrated attention and effort. You will work until you drop, and no one and nothing had better get in your way! Keep up the good pace. You're going to feel more loved than usual, and this changes absolutely everything for you.",Acquarius
"Nov 21, 2022 - A number of social invitations could come your way today, possibly connected with groups you're affiliated with. Accept as many as you can handle, Aquarius; you should have a wonderful time, learn much that fascinates you, and make some new friends. A surprise encounter with a friend or your romantic partner could bring you closer together. This may be a significant day for you.",Acquarius
"Nov 22, 2022 - Perhaps you notice some weariness today, Aquarius. You have been much more active than usual for the past few weeks. You've been communicating with new people, having new experiences, attending virtual meetings, and perhaps even taking short trips. In the long run, will any of it further your goals? That's the question you have to answer today.",Acquarius
"Nov 23, 2022 - There is a great deal of emotion and drive to the day, just the way you like it, Aquarius. Make sure you don't get stuck with the short end of the stick as the day comes to a close. An honest fight or debate is one thing, but a harsh manipulation of people is another. Make sure you're involved in the former and not the latter.",Acquarius
"Nov 24, 2022 - Pride might get in your way today, Aquarius. Perhaps you will be asked to do a task that you consider beneath you. Perhaps the people around you are feeling persnickety. Rise above the insults and make a special effort to do the best you can, defusing the situation before it gets out of hand. Tonight, enjoy an evening of watching movies or listening to music.",Acquarius
"Nov 25, 2022 - We need to have more people like you in places of power, Aquarius. And don't feel like it's out of the question. Today's astrological weather is helping you find the confidence and physical strength you need to boost your leadership abilities. This is the time to take control of the situation. You can do it!",Acquarius
"Nov 26, 2022 - What do you have to lose, Aquarius? The planets are shaking you in the hopes of ridding you of your old objectives to make way for new growth. You feel doubt where once there was only certainty. When you consider the worst that can happen, it may help you to realize that what you're clinging to really isn't all that important. It's time to let go and begin anew.",Acquarius
"Nov 27, 2022 - What an odd day, Aquarius! You feel like you've been given a one-way ticket to a faraway place. Departure is imminent, leaving you no time to pack or say goodbye. There isn't a moment to waste. You're intrigued by the adventure, yet afraid to go. All signs indicate that it will be beneficial if you get on that plane. Send your loved ones a postcard once you get to your destination.",Acquarius
"Nov 28, 2022 - You may feel a bit stodgy today, Aquarius, but things are going to pick up tonight. There will be a great deal of air to fuel your fire, and you're ready to burn! You could be like a desert of dry sagebrush just ready to be set alight. The whole mountainside is about to go up in a beautiful blaze of glory. You're ready to shine like the brilliant star that you are.",Acquarius
"Nov 29, 2022 - You will probably want everyone to know how you feel today, Aquarius. You won't be shy about expressing your emotions. Feel free to take the lead on matters, for you have the self-confidence and emotional stability to do quite well at the helm of the ship. Try not to let your mind trip over itself, however. You have the tendency to think about one issue so much that you completely lose perspective.",Acquarius
"Nov 30, 2022 - Do you feel a little under the weather, Aquarius? It's possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from those storms. As you know, the work itself isn't what gets you down but rather your worries about the future that drain your energy. Give yourself a break today. Take some time for rest and recuperation.",Acquarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Aquarius. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.",Acquarius
"Dec 1, 2022 - Family members could be upset over different frustrating events in their lives, and these moods could spill over to you. Today it would be best to leave them alone to work things out in their own way. They aren't likely to respond to sympathy. Take this opportunity to tend to some of your concerns that you may have postponed. This way, the silence in the house can work for you.",Acquarius
"Dec 2, 2022 - Things should go well for you today, Aquarius, especially in the love and romance department. Don't shy away from the obvious attraction that you have toward one special person. Today is the day to amplify that feeling instead of hiding from it. Show off your love with the brightest, boldest colors and actions possible. There is magic in the attention that you give and receive.",Acquarius
"Dec 3, 2022 - Talk to the person sitting next to you on the bus, Aquarius, or the one behind you in line at the store. He or she may have a piece of wisdom to share that will change your life forever. Know that you, too, could be that person who changes someone else's life with a single thought or piece of wisdom. Communication is the key to expanding your world in many ways.",Acquarius
"Dec 4, 2022 - This is an important day for you to give thanks for all that you have, Aquarius. Give your loved ones extra hugs and let them know how much they mean to you. If things start to get a bit too serious and somber, you're the one who can pull others out of the rut. There is no need to be sad when you have so much to be happy about.",Acquarius
"Dec 5, 2022 - Bring things back into balance, Aquarius. You've probably been so focused on yourself that you've completely forgotten about others. It's time to fill in the rest of the equation and take into account what other people feel. Balance is crucial in every part of your life so that you maintain a healthy viewpoint. A clear mind allows you to see the truth of what's really going on.",Acquarius
"Dec 6, 2022 - Today, Aquarius, you might get the chance to take a trip around the world to visit fabulous palaces and experience a timeless love, and all - get this - totally free! This could be called a sensitivity test to the universe of Walt Disney. Goodness knows that you aren't a total stranger to it! By now, you've learned from hard experience that fantasyland is for Mickey Mouse.",Acquarius
"Dec 7, 2022 - Most people form their opinions on the basis of what they're told by a few people who supposedly know what they're talking about. Certain ideas become fashionable. Today, Aquarius, you have no patience for these tendencies. In fact, you're tempted to use vulgar language just to shock the pseudo-intellectuals out of their complacency. Alas, you can't do it. They will simply raise an eyebrow and turn away.",Acquarius
"Dec 8, 2022 - New people may come into your life today. If you get bad vibes from one of them, trust your instincts! Signs are that you will meet at least one new acquaintance who isn't trustworthy. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of partnership, nor is it a good day to get married or even propose marriage. Put all plans for cementing partnerships on hold for a few days!",Acquarius
"Dec 9, 2022 - A new neighbor could arrive who you feel especially drawn to, Aquarius. You might have high hopes for a friendship with this person. He or she may seem especially congenial and share a lot of your interests, and this could seem almost too perfect. However, you're in just the mood to idealize new relationships, so don't get too excited until you get to know this person better.",Acquarius
"Dec 10, 2022 - A disagreement with a business or romantic partner could turn into an argument today. This won't do anything to increase the effectiveness of your relationship, Aquarius. If the smallest hint of a difference of opinion comes up, try to settle it before it gets too heated. Try to be objective and see the other person's point of view. Don't let a minor dispute turn into a power struggle.",Acquarius
"Dec 11, 2022 - A solid grounding is apt to be extremely important to you today, Aquarius. Hearts may be broken or won, depending on how well you play your cards. Keep in mind that the slow and steady contender is most likely going to win this race. All the talk in the world will get you nowhere. Today is about quality and action. Shoddy efforts will yield shoddy results.",Acquarius
"Dec 12, 2022 - Maintain an air of detachment, Aquarius. Feel free to delve into your fantasy world and let your emotions carry you to another realm. Today is one of those days when you might come up with a new invention that could become the next must-have item for every kitchen in the country. Let your imagination take you away. Share your lighthearted mood with others.",Acquarius
"Dec 13, 2022 - Ignite the fire in your heart, Aquarius, and make it burn more brightly than before. Keep in mind that you may need to make compromises in order to be on the same page with your lover in the way you relate emotionally. Make sure everyone gets a chance to be on center stage. Don't hog the podium. Maintain a working balance by letting others have their turn in the spotlight.",Acquarius
"Dec 14, 2022 - Aquarius, this may prove a challenging day for you. You're used to being the sovereign surrounded by courtiers currying your favor. There's something trying to draw attention away from you, reminding you that there are other people on this planet besides you. An unexpected messenger may crop up to remind you that not everything revolves around your existence.",Acquarius
"Dec 15, 2022 - Let your fun-loving nature come out to play today, Aquarius. As the day progresses, the clouds are likely to move in. There may be a more restrictive tone to your emotions that could make it difficult to express how you really feel. Focus your attention inward and realize that you can maintain a high level of self-esteem without having to prove anything.",Acquarius
"Dec 16, 2022 - Try not to be extravagant today, Aquarius. You're much better off lying low. Focus on you and what you need to do. Don't waste your time trying to attract others' attention. Let them deal with themselves while you concentrate on your goals and chores. Tackle all projects with gusto. You will find that you can be very productive as long as you stay focused and calm.",Acquarius
"Dec 17, 2022 - Your energy and spunk should finally return after a couple days of feeling slightly down, Aquarius. You should enjoy a good mood all day. Your powers of persuasion are strong. There's an extra boost of energy behind your emotions. You will find that this could lead to some sort of transformation deep within. Whatever you do, do it with passion. Let your courageous nature shine through.",Acquarius
"Dec 18, 2022 - Your greatest quality is generosity, Aquarius. Your nature isn't to give to others in order to get something back but for the pleasure of giving. This is how you get power and light. Think of all the people in the world who give of themselves without expecting anything in return. You don't have to make much effort to be one of those people - just give it a try.",Acquarius
"Dec 19, 2022 - You have a lot to offer, Aquarius. Everyone appreciates what you have to contribute. Yet you've been unable to give yourself credit for all that you've accomplished. It would be worthwhile to take some time to contemplate why this is so. You have a strong need to be loved, but you must first love yourself. Your family and friends will support you, but first you must support yourself.",Acquarius
"Dec 20, 2022 - There are days when you should take everything with a grain of salt. Today you may realize how important it is to gain the appreciation and respect of a certain person. It isn't worth getting worked up about. You will only make things worse. You may just need to do something that puts the fire back into your emotions.",Acquarius
"Dec 21, 2022 - Be careful about the way your words come across to others, Aquarius. You might not realize how much other people's feelings are affected until it's too late. Consider backing off for a while and taking a break from your normal performance. Practice your lines at home. You may be in a bit of a funk, but the good news is that you will snap out of it very soon.",Acquarius
"Dec 22, 2022 - The world probably isn't going to revolve around you today, Aquarius, so get used to it. Even though this may not be the news you want to hear, it's probably the news you most need to hear. Use your incredible passion to nurture others. Think less about yourself and more about the people around you, especially your family. Stick close to home and take care of chores.",Acquarius
"Dec 23, 2022 - Your artistic side likes to communicate with people who are a shade off normal. You call them eccentric - other people call them crazy! From your viewpoint, the crazier the better! You feel such people add interest to the lives of anyone they come in contact with. Take a look in the mirror. You may see that you're such a person. Your energy and creativity add sparkle to others' lives.",Acquarius
"Dec 24, 2022 - You greet the day energized! Your confidence is at an all-time high because of recent events. You have every reason to be proud of what you've accomplished, especially at work. But your love life could benefit from the same level of commitment. Why not be proactive? Arrange a romantic evening for you and your partner. What a difference a few hours can make in your relationship!",Acquarius
"Dec 25, 2022 - The more you let your ego and fantasies swell today, Aquarius, the more friction you will encounter. Others aren't going to be fooled, nor are they going to want to deal with frivolity. You might consider letting someone else take the lead while you focus more on your internal energy. Don't be surprised if you cry for no apparent reason. It's important that the tears come out.",Acquarius
"Dec 26, 2022 - Get your life in order today, Aquarius. Shed the false persona you've been wearing and really look in the mirror. Make sure you like the person you see. This is a good day to put frivolity aside and concentrate on what you need to accomplish. Tend to your duties and plan wisely for the future. Store up your resources instead of squandering them all now.",Acquarius
"Dec 27, 2022 - It may be upsetting to you, Aquarius, but there's something you need to think about. You should finally get it through your head that the people you often call ""brilliant"" are only reflections of you. If this month you decide to have a little faith in yourself and assert yourself a little, you could be in for some very nice surprises! You'll see!",Acquarius
"Dec 28, 2022 - It's possible that you're having some ups and downs in your love life at the moment. Someone may be asking you to play another role than you're used to playing in your relationship. Today, Aquarius, you should take the time to think about these pressures on you. You're going to need the answers to these questions over the next few months.",Acquarius
"Dec 29, 2022 - Some of you still let individuals from other Zodiac signs do all the creating for you. The planetary configuration today pushes you to free yourself from the ties that bind you. It's time for you to show more creativity. Show the gems that you usually hide. Express yourself fully, without hesitation. Show others who's really in charge.",Acquarius
"Dec 30, 2022 - It may be hard to resolve anything today, Aquarius. It could be that there's an overwhelming resistance making it difficult to act according to plan. Today isn't a good day to fight. If things don't seem to be going your way, don't push it. Trying to strong-arm the situation will only aggravate things and make them worse. You may need to make some compromises in order to maintain the peace.",Acquarius
"Dec 31, 2022 - You may not feel in sync with the day's energy, Aquarius. Something about it may not sit right with you. Your natural instinct to want to take the lead may be overshadowed by an unwillingness to even get up. You may feel like your internal fire is squelched, especially when it comes to love and beauty. If your mind is cloudy, don't worry about it. The fog will clear soon.",Acquarius
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces

For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2022 - Take charge of your overall health today, Pisces. You’ll likely wake up feeling energetic and well. Seize this opportunity to be active in doing things that will help continue your good feelings. Consider all aspects of your health, including emotional and spiritual. If you can, sit outside in the sunshine and fresh air to consider the areas of your life that could use a workout. Take a walk, do some gardening, engage in something both creative and physical.",Pisces
"Feb 5, 2022 - When was the last time you used a pen and paper, Pisces? In this age of computers, the keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides much more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of the rhythmic motion of writing with a pen is far more soothing and even healing than most realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good and unlock places within you that aren't accessed by typing. Try it today.",Pisces
"Feb 6, 2022 - If something is bothering you today, Pisces, consider talking with your mother or an older person you feel comfortable with. No matter where we are in life, there remains a part of us that draws support and nurturing from someone with more experience. Draw some strength from this valuable resource by visiting or calling. Remember to express your gratitude for this supportive relationship.",Pisces
"Feb 7, 2022 - It's the perfect day to do some planning, Pisces. Take the time on a regular basis to think about the things you want to do and accomplish. It’s essential for feeling you have control over your life. It can be almost impossible to reach your goals without a concrete plan. Just as you wouldn't build a house without a plan, it isn't wise to build a life without one either.",Pisces
"Feb 8, 2022 - Good decision making will be a prominent asset today, Pisces. It's an excellent time to make a list of things that you’ve either put off or haven't been able to settle on. This doesn't need to be things that are just related to work or finances. Consider putting effort into your personal life as well. If there are issues surrounding friends, your romantic partner, or family, this is a great opportunity to think up options.",Pisces
"Feb 9, 2022 - Some revealing conversations with friends or relatives could bring up old traumatic memories from the past that you may have been repressing. This could shed light on a lot of obstacles you've been encountering lately, Pisces, and thus enable you to release these emotions and do away with the obstacles. Once that happens, the sky's the limit! Your personal power and self-confidence should be stronger than ever. Go for the gold!",Pisces
"Feb 10, 2022 - Some welcome visitors from far away could come to see you today and cause temporary chaos in your home. You'll be glad to see them, however, Pisces, as they'll have some great news and fascinating information to pass on to you and your family. You'll want to introduce them to other friends who share your interests. This could give rise to a horrendously messy house, but you'll have fun anyway. Prepare for a highly social evening!",Pisces
"Feb 11, 2022 - Some rather tedious and boring paperwork you have to handle for your business might be a pain in the neck now, Pisces, but it should bring a lot of benefits to you later. Therefore, you'll want to exercise your usual conscientiousness in order to assure that it gets completed. Your diligence and dedication should attract the attention of those in authority, so expect advancement in some way. Onward and upward!",Pisces
"Feb 12, 2022 - There are forces working in your favor that you should be sure to latch onto and take advantage of, Pisces. You’ll find that your sense of duty and ability to plan are paying off in a very positive way. You’ll find that you’re able to check quite a few things off your list today. Think before you act and take a time-out to rest and regroup if you need to.",Pisces
"Feb 13, 2022 - Someone close to you could develop some strange symptoms that cause this person to panic. It never hurts to consult a doctor, but when this person does, he or she is likely to find that these problems are probably nothing more than stress, too much work, or overindulgence in food or drink. Therefore, don't you panic, too! You might find yourself making phone calls or running errands to enable your friend to get some rest.",Pisces
"Feb 14, 2022 - Business matters take a sudden turn for the better, Pisces. Paperwork may need to be executed. A new sense of self-confidence contributes to these developments, and the more good things that happen to you, the more confident you’ll feel. Your physical appearance could assume more importance in your mind than usual, since you'll want the way you look to match the way you feel inside. Buy some new clothes and keep working. The sky's the limit.",Pisces
"Feb 15, 2022 - Expect a lot of letters and phone calls from lovers, close friends, or children today, Pisces. You might also want to make a few yourself. Some positive and interesting information may have come your way that you'll want to share with those close to you. You could also want to try your hand at writing. You'll want to make sure that you remember whatever it is you learn today, Pisces, as it could prove valuable in the future.",Pisces
"Feb 16, 2022 - Temporary difficulties at home might cause you to want to stay and resolve them rather than go to work or anywhere else. However, Pisces, career matters may also be pressing, so you're likely to be in a bit of a quandary. At this time, the wisest decision is likely to be to take care of your personal life first. Professional matters will still be waiting for you tomorrow.",Pisces
"Feb 17, 2022 - Someone who is a student of natural healing may come to visit you and share some ideas today. You tend to be interested in matters concerning health, and you might want to learn not only about herbs and nutrition but also spiritual healing. This is a good time to train your own healing abilities, Pisces, as your sensitivity is high and you’re more able than usual to tune in to the healing energies.",Pisces
"Feb 18, 2022 - A friend, perhaps a woman, could well be upset or even angry with you today, Pisces. Money might be involved in some way. There may be nothing you can do to reassure her at this time, so it's best to give what reassurances you can and then back off. Whatever has gone wrong, she's probably overreacting, and eventually she'll see that. In the meantime, you do what you can to work off your own anxieties. Hang in there!",Pisces
"Feb 19, 2022 - A family member could be feeling a little down, Pisces, and you may be tempted to give him or her a pep talk to get them going again. Don't. They won't respond to it, and this could create tension in the home. Your own self-confidence is probably at an all-time low. You tend to be your own worst critic in the best of times, but today you're a bit confused. Try to be fair to everyone around you, especially yourself.",Pisces
"Feb 20, 2022 - If you've got something you're trying to study, Pisces, this isn’t the day to do it. Your concentration is likely to be off, and what you're reading will probably look like Greek to you. Unless it’s really necessary, it would be best to put the books aside until tomorrow, since you probably won't absorb much today. Trying to read could give rise to the illusion that you've learned something. Be on the safe side and put it off!",Pisces
"Feb 21, 2022 - Today will be a lovely combination of harmony and passion. Make the most of it, Pisces. With things running so smoothly at work, there's no reason you can't leave the office early to prepare for a special evening with your partner. Pull out all the stops tonight. Scented candles, a fabulous meal, and an even more fabulous outfit. Have a rich, gooey dessert on hand (although it's likely you won't get around to eating it).",Pisces
"Feb 22, 2022 - It’s possible that you could fear for your job today, Pisces. Fortunately, those fears are unfounded. There is a lot of upheaval occurring at work. You’re best advised to steer clear of it, if you can. If you continue to do your job well, you’re likely to receive a bonus or promotion as a result of your efforts. You've earned it.",Pisces
"Feb 23, 2022 - Construction on streets or buildings might make it difficult for you to get around your neighborhood today, Pisces. Traffic could be backed up for blocks. If you must run errands, either walk or get them done early in the day. The work could foul up the phone lines as well, at least for a while, so you might miss some calls you needed to take. This could be a frustrating day. Keep yourself busy at home.",Pisces
"Feb 24, 2022 - You’ve always had psychic ability, and today it’s at a peak, Pisces. Perhaps not coincidentally, you’re likely to be contacted by a close friend or lover from your past. He or she isn’t calling to renew your relationship but rather for advice. Your heightened abilities today make you the ideal confidant. Listen closely and advise what your heart tells you is right.",Pisces
"Feb 25, 2022 - You can expect a warm and friendly environment at work today, Pisces. Enjoy the conversations with your co-workers, but don't take anything at face value. There may be someone in your midst out to sabotage you. You don't need to worry about it too much, just take care to document any ideas or insights you have. You may need proof that they’re original.",Pisces
"Feb 26, 2022 - You're finally setting in motion some longstanding goals of yours, Pisces. Good for you! But even though everything is in place and you're ready to go, it's possible that you'll receive notice today of some delay in your plans. The frustration feels unbearable. But when you step back and look at the bigger picture, you'll see that ultimately this delay is in your best interests.",Pisces
"Feb 27, 2022 - Today you might notice a change in yourself, Pisces. You could look in the mirror and see that you suddenly look as gorgeous as a movie star. This change in your outer self is due to transformations taking place within. You've probably been releasing a lot of old traumas from the past, and therefore considerable stress and tension have vanished from your face. Treat yourself to some new clothes. It's a great time to do it!",Pisces
"Feb 28, 2022 - There is such a thing as being too honest, Pisces. You've experienced in the past how your determination to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth can cause hurt feelings. Today try to exercise a bit of tact and diplomacy. You will still be able to get your point across, with the added bonus that your audience will still be speaking to you once you've done so.",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"Mar 1, 2022 - You tend to be your own worst critic, Pisces, and today you're more likely to be that way. Recent setbacks on the job might find you harboring doubts about your own capabilities. Be objective about the situation. Whatever happened was probably above and beyond your control, so it isn't fair to doubt yourself because of it. Work hard, continue to do the best you can, and don't let outside events sap your belief in yourself.",Pisces
"Mar 2, 2022 - There could be a bit of confusion in your world today, Pisces. Trying to make sense of what's going on might not be the easiest task. Rational thinking and analytical processes may not be the best way to find the solution. You might be better off just letting the issue sit for now and deal with it later when the facts are clearer. Let go of control and the desire to make sense of it all. Instead, just relax and let the day take you where it will.",Pisces
"Mar 3, 2022 - Your health has been glowing over the past few weeks, Pisces, but today you're likely to feel a little under the weather. This is probably due to nothing more exotic than stress. You've been working hard and concentrating on little else, so your body is now rebelling. You need some rest. Take time off and relax a little, and don't feel guilty about it. Even the President needs alone time occasionally.",Pisces
"Mar 4, 2022 - As the world economy continues to boom, Pisces, don't be surprised if you're surrounded by new work possibilities. More than one chance to increase your income could come your way today. The problem will be wading through all these opportunities and trying to decide which is the most appealing and workable for you. List your options and outline the pros and cons of each. Writing things down can sometimes make them clearer.",Pisces
"Mar 5, 2022 - There may be a stalemate when you're unwilling to express your feelings, Pisces. You might automatically assume that things will go smoothly if you leave the decisions up to someone else. Unfortunately, that plan will likely backfire if the decision is made by someone who doesn't necessarily have your best interests at heart. You may try to go back and reverse what has been done, thus fouling up the plan that has been set in motion.",Pisces
"Mar 6, 2022 - You could find the hardest person to face is you, Pisces. You tend toward introspection, and you may find yourself shrinking into self-recrimination. You could analyze the important people in your life and yet fail to address the one you really need to look at – you. As you continually strive for perfection, give yourself proper credit. Do something nice for yourself today.",Pisces
"Mar 7, 2022 - You may be on a slow, steady track of discipline that embraces an older, more traditional way of looking at things, Pisces. Suddenly, however, you're hit by an aggressive force urging you to do things differently. The more you try to resist this force, the more it's apt to cause friction and tension. Open your arms and welcome this new energy that will have a very positive effect on you.",Pisces
"Mar 8, 2022 - An evening at home with your sweetheart could seem very appealing today, Pisces. Sex and romance are very much on your mind, and you might surprise yourself with how Earthy you feel. You could decide to pick up a romantic novel or see a sexy movie. You could learn to communicate better with your partner today, both verbally and physically. Make sure you look your best, and go for it!",Pisces
"Mar 9, 2022 - Take action to create a fanciful dream world today, Pisces. Indeed, many of the activities of the day will be touched with an air of otherworldliness. Even though you generally like to keep your feet on the ground, realize that once in a while it's essential to let go and experience other realms of thought in order to gain new perspective. Let your hair down and go wild tonight.",Pisces
"Mar 10, 2022 - You're sailing along and suddenly see a big ramp in front of you, Pisces. Your choice: avoid the ramp, stay on the ground where you know it's safe, and be content with a limited worldview, or hit that ramp head on and soar over the trees and beyond. Who knows where you might land? There is an incredible adventure waiting for you when you take that leap into the unknown.",Pisces
"Mar 11, 2022 - Make sure that you're living consciously at this time, Pisces. It could be that you're going through a period of denial and simply refusing to see the truth of the situation. Open up your eyes to the world around you so you can invite in joy and compassion. Don't be satisfied with superficial interactions that don't really satisfy you emotionally and intellectually.",Pisces
"Mar 12, 2022 - Put an extra spring in your step, Pisces. The slow, steady pace may be something that you're comfortable with, but note that the situations of the day call for something much more dynamic and brave. Pull out your leadership hat and put it on proudly. Today is the day for you to call the shots, instead of compromising in order to get along with others.",Pisces
"Mar 13, 2022 - Optimism and enthusiasm for the months ahead have you feeling confident and strong. The sky's the limit! A male visitor could have some surprising news for you. This is a great day to make investments or purchase property. If you've been expecting money through legal papers or contracts, it could come in the mail today. The night could bring vivid and interesting dreams. In all, it's a thoroughly satisfying day.",Pisces
"Mar 14, 2022 - Yes, you can be proud of yourself, Pisces. You really know your stuff. You have committed yourself to deepening your knowledge and capabilities and it really shows. Friends and family members will be coming to you for advice, and rightfully so. Try not to grow complacent, though. It's an easy trap to fall into. You'll need to continue full-speed ahead on your educational journey in order to keep that edge!",Pisces
"Mar 15, 2022 - A project that you've worked on for a long time could bring some money your way, Pisces. Don't be too disappointed if you don't have it in your hands today. There might be a short delay of some kind, perhaps due to problems with the mail service. You might be turning your thoughts now to new projects. While you have a lot of ideas, you aren't likely to make firm decisions today.",Pisces
"Mar 16, 2022 - Go ahead and make a list today, Pisces. Powerful emotions are likely to lure you from your current path unless you have some sort of concrete plan to fall back on. Put idle hands to use by delegating tasks to the people around you. You'll be amazed at the little blocks of time you have when you stay on task and keep yourself and everyone else around you in motion.",Pisces
"Mar 17, 2022 - A creative project, perhaps one that could earn you some money, might well be the primary focus of your attention today. Perhaps you've been doing some writing or intend to teach a class. You might want to give the idea some thought, Pisces, if you haven't already. Your physical and mental energies are high. Success is strongly indicated if you start the ball rolling.",Pisces
"Mar 18, 2022 - Let your emotions play with your imagination today, and feel free to discuss your findings openly with others, Pisces. Don't get caught up in so rational a frame of mind that you refuse to acknowledge any other way of viewing a current situation. Put away your analytical side in order to disclose a more abstract, intuitive perspective. Exercise that part of your brain that doesn't normally get used.",Pisces
"Mar 19, 2022 - A temporary separation from someone close to you could have you reflecting on the good times you've spent together, especially over the past few weeks. You're likely to talk with him or her on the phone. You're feeling a lot of warmth and affection toward everyone around you, but a little sad as well, particularly when you think of those far away. Call them up, Pisces! They'll be glad to hear from you.",Pisces
"Mar 20, 2022 - Visitors could come to your home tonight, Pisces, possibly for an informal get-together of some kind. Dear friends might be involved in some way. You're likely to be very busy during the day, perhaps tying up loose ends. Your mind is probably going a thousand miles an hour, so you'll need to wind down before going to bed tonight. You don't want to lose any sleep.",Pisces
"Mar 21, 2022 - You may start the day feeling a little insecure about everything going on around you, Pisces. The increased pressures of work might have strained your nerves a little. However, a lot of love and attention from friends, children, and the special person in your life should have you feeling better about everything in no time. In the evening, relax and watch a video with your mate!",Pisces
"Mar 22, 2022 - Work on your own projects may be very much on your mind today, Pisces. They could involve studies of some kind or the arts. It's possible that you may be considering innovative ways of earning extra money. All signs indicate that any enterprise begun or continued today is likely to succeed, so go to it. However, it's important to give whatever you're working on a lot of thought before presenting it to others.",Pisces
"Mar 23, 2022 - An important lost object, perhaps a paper of some kind, could command the attention of your entire household, Pisces. This could prove frustrating at first, because you will know that it has to be somewhere in the house, but you can't find it anywhere! The item may reappear just as you've given up on it, in a place you never would have imagined! Tip: it's probably hidden among other objects.",Pisces
"Mar 24, 2022 - If you've been thinking about taking a trip, Pisces, this isn't the day to make plans. Whatever you learn today about airline schedules or hotels may not reflect the situation as it really is. If you wait a few days, things should go far more smoothly. If you already have plans to leave, expect some delays. Don't let them put you in a gloomy state of mind! Make up your mind to have fun!",Pisces
"Mar 25, 2022 - Study of intellectual or spiritual subjects that particularly interest you could keep you at home for much of the day, Pisces. More than one visitor might drop by in order to discuss these matters, perhaps bringing a few books. Discussions could take on an imaginative, idealistic, and even mystical level, which could prove inspiring for all involved. Take notes, because you'll want to be sure and remember these conversations.",Pisces
"Mar 26, 2022 - You may be asked to swallow your pride and give in to someone else's will today, Pisces. This will be difficult for you to do. Try to concentrate on your good reasons for obedience, and work out your frustration by taking a brisk walk. Expect to receive some welcome news from another source, which will also help calm you down. Relax with a group of supportive friends tonight.",Pisces
"Mar 27, 2022 - You could spend much of your day advancing the interests of an organization dedicated to a cause that means a lot to you, Pisces, perhaps in animal or children's rights. You tend to be service oriented by nature, and today something you learn, perhaps from TV or the Internet, could excite your desire to make a difference to those you wish to serve. Expect to derive a lot of satisfaction from this. You're making a difference!",Pisces
"Mar 28, 2022 - Have you been thinking about taking a course in one of the arts, Pisces? Whether your preference is painting, music, drama, dance, or creative writing, if you commit now, you'll probably continue with it. The practical arts of cooking, building, or interior decoration are also possibilities. Whatever it is, it won't be quickly abandoned. If you begin with the idea of eventually doing it professionally, chances are you will. Good luck!",Pisces
"Mar 29, 2022 - Are things really going this beautifully for you, Pisces? This is a question you might ask yourself now. All looks perfect as career, romance, education, and spiritual matters seem to crystallize into a wonderful life. Don't waste time worrying if this is all too good to be true! You're concerned about the future, but right now, live in the moment. You're creating some great memories, if nothing else. Enjoy!",Pisces
"Mar 30, 2022 - A financial goal you've been hoping to reach very soon might seem right around the corner, Pisces, but there still seem to be a thousand things you have to do before it's actually realized. This could get you down temporarily, but don't get stuck there. Make a list of whatever needs to be done and then tackle each task one at a time until the goal is reached. Get busy!",Pisces
"Mar 31, 2022 - Today's planetary configuration will give you a strong urge to be out and about, Pisces, but responsibilities could keep you at home or the office. Perhaps you're waiting for a delivery or an important phone call or visitor. This could be boring and rather tedious for you today. Find something to do that engrosses you, even if it's only reading or catching up on paperwork. There's no point in just twiddling your thumbs!",Pisces
"Apr 1, 2022 - It could be difficult for you to think straight today, Pisces. Your brain is probably working in short, erratic bursts that keep you guessing about which way to proceed. Avoid confusion during the day by periodically centering and separating yourself and your feelings from the drama around you. Don't pretend you understand something if you don't. If a situation doesn't make sense, go ahead and question it.",Pisces
"Apr 2, 2022 - Your attitude is calm and matter-of-fact when talking to others, Pisces. You tell it like it is while omitting the frills and fantasies. You have no reason to hide the truth, so you're happy to disclose information to any willing listener. Be careful, because you could get into someone else's private business uninvited. If you hear some secret information, you could tell it to others who definitely shouldn't hear it.",Pisces
"Apr 3, 2022 - Take care of your friends by supporting their ideas, Pisces. Be careful that you don't automatically encourage a plan or viewpoint that you know is wrong or doomed to fail. Even though you might want to make them feel good by saying exactly what they want to hear, this isn't really doing them any favors. People come up with some wild schemes, so it's important to bring a levelheaded perspective to the table.",Pisces
"Apr 4, 2022 - If you have children, Pisces, you could be feeling a bit overworked and overwhelmed. If you don't have children, perhaps the constraints and demands of your professional life are weighing heavily on your mind. Don't worry - these feelings shall pass. Expect an opportunity to get free of the ties that bind. Even though it will only be a temporary respite, take advantage of it!",Pisces
"Apr 5, 2022 - Today isn't a day for meditation, Pisces. The planetary energies are asking you to step outside of yourself and get back into the world again! You've been doing an awful lot of thinking about your image recently, and now you're going to have to test out how the ""new and improved"" you operates in your daily life. You can expect some pleasant feedback and truly lasting changes!",Pisces
"Apr 6, 2022 - A rather disconcerting rumor about your job could reach your ears, Pisces. Perhaps you'll hear that the company is being sold or undergoing a shakeup in the hierarchy. You might get caught up in a frenzy of worry about whether or not you'll stay on. Before jumping to any conclusions, phone someone who knows what's going on and find out the truth. What you've heard is probably just gossip.",Pisces
"Apr 7, 2022 - Paperwork involving money needs to be executed today, Pisces. It could be a settlement, new commission, or bonus of some kind. This is likely to be a joyous occasion because money is coming your way, even though the paperwork itself might be a drag. Try to concentrate and get it done quickly so you and those close to you can go out and celebrate. Make a reservation at your favorite restaurant.",Pisces
"Apr 8, 2022 - Today you could look in the mirror and panic about your appearance, Pisces. You might be feeling a little under the weather and look a little tired. Nonetheless, you probably look a lot better than you think you do. Don't fall into the trap of blowing every little flaw out of proportion. A little rest is probably all you need in order to look like yourself again.",Pisces
"Apr 9, 2022 - Today you could feel full of energy and eager to get out for some exercise, Pisces, but other responsibilities might threaten to keep you from doing it. The resulting frustration could zap all your energy and put you in a lethargic mood. Don't fall into this trap! Get the most urgent tasks done and then get the exercise you need. This way, you can recoup both your physical and mental energy.",Pisces
"Apr 10, 2022 - Ingenuity blossoms when you make the effort to do a little writing, Pisces, perhaps technical manuals or other professionally oriented projects. This could represent a new stage in your professional life. You're apt to do well and attract considerable attention from higher-ups. Don't get too caught up in the need to revise, edit, then revise and edit again. It will only take up time, and it's possible to do too much rewriting.",Pisces
"Apr 11, 2022 - You should be feeling physically strong, healthy, and energetic today, Pisces, although you could also be a little lightheaded. You could experience the sensation of wandering around in a daze with your feet on the ground and your head in the clouds. Achieving balance won't be easy, but you should be able to manage it today. Concentrate on activities that involve spiritual or imaginative faculties today.",Pisces
"Apr 12, 2022 - You like to feel needed, Pisces, but today you might throw up your hands and say, ""Enough!"" You've given so much of yourself for so long that friends and loved ones tend to think of your largesse as a right rather than a privilege. Today, remind them of their error. Take a day off from indentured servitude. Go to a fancy restaurant and enjoy being waited on. Don't forget to leave a big tip.",Pisces
"Apr 13, 2022 - A warm, loving phone call or letter could come your way today from a lover or close friend who's presently out of town. You'll wish with all your heart that he or she could be home! In the meantime, you're likely to keep yourself quite busy, Pisces. Creative projects, activities in your community, or both could keep you too busy to miss anyone too much. Tonight, spend some time alone.",Pisces
"Apr 14, 2022 - It's hard to imagine a world without computers, Pisces. Technology has been key to your professional life, and it's likely to be even more important in the future. Expect your income to increase dramatically this year as a result of a technological innovation. You could play a part in developing it, or more likely, find a creative use for it. Eat well and rest up, because you'll need a lot of energy soon.",Pisces
"Apr 15, 2022 - OK, up and at 'em, Pisces! You might feel like you're walking through sand today, but you really need to shake your booty and get the blood flowing. If you don't get up and do something, you'll be a slug all day. You need to clear your head and cast off that bloated feeling. Most importantly, you want to get a good start to the day so you can accomplish everything that awaits you.",Pisces
"Apr 16, 2022 - This could be a day of technical glitches and malfunctions, Pisces. It's frustrating, to be sure, but a little bit funny, too. Everything you touch, from computer to washing machine, seems to groan and shudder before finally breaking. Apparently, today you have the opposite of the Midas touch. Don't take it personally. Instead, use it as an excuse to do something out of the ordinary with your time.",Pisces
"Apr 17, 2022 - This is a good day for you to analyze information, Pisces. You have an especially acute business sense, which you should use to your advantage. Whether you're thinking of translating a creative project into a business proposal or working on that business plan, all indications say that your efforts will yield rich rewards. Make the most of whatever this day has to offer.",Pisces
"Apr 18, 2022 - You may be in a quiet, reflective mood today, Pisces. You could receive a communication from an old friend that sets you remembering the good old days of your youth. You can't help but look at some of your pivotal decisions and wonder how your life would have been different had you made other choices. It's pointless to play that game. Don't wonder about ""what if.” Embrace what you have.",Pisces
"Apr 19, 2022 - Be careful of people who talk a great deal and promise the world but have a difficult time delivering the goods, Pisces. You might get trapped today if you rely on people who simply don't come through the way they said they would. Feel free to engage in social activities with partners, but don't sign any major business deals with them at this time.",Pisces
"Apr 20, 2022 - A friend or neighbor you need to contact could be in and out all day, Pisces, and so you could have trouble reaching him or her. Phone or email probably won't work, since your friend could be too busy to check messages. The best way to make contact might be to hop in the car and drive to wherever they might be. Take the side streets, however. The main roads are probably clogged with traffic!",Pisces
"Apr 21, 2022 - Have you been reading about how a positive mental outlook creates a healthy body and a happy life, Pisces? If so, you might just find that this attitude brings results. You're feeling strong, fit, and mentally sharp. Career interests seem to be looking up for you. A fringe benefit is that you're probably feeling especially intuitive, too. Keep doing whatever you've been doing to bring this all about, because it's working!",Pisces
"Apr 22, 2022 - If you're single, Pisces, tonight you could find yourself longing for a lover from the past and wondering what's happening with this person right now. If you're currently involved, you might be experiencing a temporary separation from your beloved, and could feel inclined to spend the evening at home. If you choose to do this, entertain yourself with a favorite book or movie. Remember - a watched phone never rings!",Pisces
"Apr 23, 2022 - This is a day to stay close to home and organize the house. You might be thinking how you can best utilize your living space. It's clear that some improvements are in order, Pisces. Perhaps you could begin by tackling all those minor repairs that you've been putting off. Once those are done, a fresh coat of paint will do wonders to brighten both your home and your outlook.",Pisces
"Apr 24, 2022 - It's time to refill the well of your soul, Pisces. You spend so much of your life in service to others that it's only natural that you feel drained sometimes. Rather than try to push past this feeling and go on as though nothing is the matter, consider it a sign that something is amiss. Admit if you're feeling unappreciated. You've spent too much time putting the happiness of others before your own. It's time to change your priorities.",Pisces
"Apr 25, 2022 - You're interested in better understanding yourself and your reactions to the world around you. Well, Pisces, today you should take the time to look over your successes and failures, especially where your family life is concerned. The atmosphere is changing and things will be much more positive over the next few days. Think about sharing with other people what you have learned.",Pisces
"Apr 26, 2022 - Be sure to answer all phone calls and open all letters and emails today, Pisces. You're likely to receive some interesting news. You might get word from a former boss that you'd be perfect for a new position opening up in his or her office. Or perhaps an old lover makes tentative inquiries about renewing old bonds. Your eyebrows will rise in surprise at least once during this day. Expect the unexpected!",Pisces
"Apr 27, 2022 - Some blatantly untrue gossip could reach you today, Pisces. When you think about it, you'll see that what you heard defies all logic and is actually rather ludicrous. However, the person who reports it to you could be so dynamic and persuasive that you believe it for a little while. Remember to check the facts in such situations. You'll stay grounded in reality rather than get caught up in fantasy.",Pisces
"Apr 28, 2022 - Career matters should be going very well for you today, Pisces. A sudden change regarding your work could catapult you into a position you've been hoping to reach for a long time. A rise in income could result. You've worked hard and done very well, so what may seem a lucky break to others is actually the result of intense, determined effort on your part. Enjoy your success and make the most of it.",Pisces
"Apr 29, 2022 - You might pick up some rather disturbing thoughts from a friend, neighbor, or relative, Pisces. This person could be upset over something and not communicating his or her feelings. It isn't appropriate to try to coax this person into sharing with you now. They aren't upset with you, but they might be if you push! Back off and let this person come to terms with the problem. Your friend will talk the time is right.",Pisces
"Apr 30, 2022 - You seem to want to become old and wise before your time, Pisces. Today's aspects will take you by the hand and lead you back into the heat of the action, experiencing life in all its intensity. Yes, we know you're really afraid of all this. But if you don't get back into action, you'll stay alone in your little corner. The world needs you. Don't stay at home!",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"May 1, 2022 - The astral energy is encouraging you to open up more to your world, culture, and ways of thinking, Pisces. You don't have to go off alone in the desert to reinvent everything. For you, this would be the easy way out, because it would allow you to hide! Develop your curiosity about what exists in this society. Your opinion will carry weight later on.",Pisces
"May 2, 2022 - You may feel like you're being left out of the equation, Pisces. Perhaps you feel like the oddball, the fifth wheel who simply doesn't have a place. Don't worry. Just because you feel that way today doesn't mean it's your destiny. If you don't like your course, change your position. If you don't like the people you're with, move in a different social circle. Don't blame your circumstances on others. Take responsibility.",Pisces
"May 3, 2022 - You are particularly inspired by and sensitive to crisis situations. What that means is that you can't stand to see other people suffer. Sometimes even you suffer because you don't allow yourself to do the things you like best and the things that help you feel fulfilled as a person. Why don't you think about going easier on yourself, just for today? Try it - you might like it!",Pisces
"May 4, 2022 - Today you might find that a long-term dream finally comes true. Perhaps a trip that you've fantasized about for a long time finally shows promise of actually happening, Pisces. A practical and methodical approach to arranging the details should make it seem that much more real to you. However, do take care to plan each step carefully so that you don't end up working harder than necessary.",Pisces
"May 5, 2022 - Invitations to attend social events, perhaps business related, could bring surprising results, Pisces. You might meet more than one person who shares some of your interests, and these people could become friends. Expect some interesting practical and philosophical discussions. An opportunity to travel abroad or to a distant state might open up for you. This could prove to be a most exciting and stimulating day. Make the most of it!",Pisces
"May 6, 2022 - You may feel indecisive, insecure, and stuck in the middle of a difficult situation, Pisces. Your energy could be drawn in one direction while your self-confidence is pulled in another. This dilemma has to do with your inability to integrate different aspects of your life that you try to keep separate. Try to look at things in terms of the whole. Notice how your actions in one part of your life have a ripple effect everywhere else.",Pisces
"May 7, 2022 - Your warm, loving, romantic nature is noticed whether you realize it or not, Pisces. Perhaps you sometimes feel like there isn't enough excitement in your life - especially your love life. Don't think this means you need to change in order to please others. Your stable, quiet nature is comforting to those who understand and appreciate it. The last thing you want to do today is pretend to be someone you aren't.",Pisces
"May 8, 2022 - It's time to elevate your sense of self, Pisces. You're just as good as anyone else, so why don't you believe it? The problem is that you're very sensitive about having an ego. Even though you know everyone does, you punish yourself for its existence! This is a noble idea, but it doesn't do you any good. You'll never be perfect and neither will anyone else. What are you worrying about?",Pisces
"May 9, 2022 - No one dislikes red tape and bureaucracy more than you. But take advantage of the atmosphere today. If you have any applications to submit or formalities to complete, you'll find the process much easier than usual. Communication channels that are normally closed will open, and the administrative mechanisms will be well oiled instead of grinding. Get all administrative tasks done so you won't have to think about them again!",Pisces
"May 10, 2022 - You can expect today to be tense, Pisces, as the people close to you are likely to be especially irritable. Adults and children alike may throw tantrums for no reason, and you'll be criticized for having overlooked some small detail. Fortunately, your new awareness helps you realize that you aren't obligated to do anyone any favors. In this new role, you're able to express your discontent with a quiet, calm authority.",Pisces
"May 11, 2022 - Here is a day of challenges, Pisces. You're a pro at questioning yourself, as you'll prove today when you take a hard look at your accomplishments. What have you created of a personal nature in the last ten years? Have you followed someone else's example because you doubted yourself? Have you been eternally “almost” ready? Have you dared to jump into projects that were still imperfect? These are the questions that need to be addressed.",Pisces
"May 12, 2022 - A group might invite you to participate in a creative project of some kind today, Pisces. Whatever you do is likely to be stimulating and exciting. You'll want to channel a lot of energy and enthusiasm into it. You could find yourself thinking in terms of a partnership, making plans to explore the possibility further. This is a great day for socializing. If you receive an invitation to go out, go!",Pisces
"May 13, 2022 - Today's planetary energy should compel you to commit certain acts of self-affirmation that are needed to define your territory and protect your rights. You'll be encouraged to explore your desires and personal tastes and express your opinion openly and clearly. Everyone has an identity to claim! Don't be bashful about claiming yours now.",Pisces
"May 14, 2022 - The good news is it can only get better. For today, however, there may be some trying times in store, Pisces. If you're a parent, the children will beg for something every five minutes. At work, you'll feel pressure from all sides. Not even your love life is immune from the doubt that seems to hover over you. No compromise is possible today. Just sit tight and know that calmer days are coming.",Pisces
"May 15, 2022 - The great period of meditation that started for you a few weeks ago is now finished, Pisces. This means that you are going to have to get back into the real world again! You are going to have to test out how the ""new and improved"" you operates in everyday life. Get ready. You can expect some real changes!",Pisces
"May 16, 2022 - It may be difficult to express yourself fully today, Pisces. Somehow the words aren't coming out quite as clearly as you'd like. Powerful emotions are getting in the way. It could be difficult for you to find solid footing on such a muddy surface. Don't try to confine yourself to one way of doing something. Patience is a key virtue now. Wait until things clear before you proceed.",Pisces
"May 17, 2022 - There are moments when your powers of clear thinking reveal the tremendous amount of maturity that you have, Pisces. You aren't usually a dreamer, so it's rather difficult to lead you into ambiguous situations. If you currently have sentimental affairs going on in your life, this would be an excellent day to take stock. But try not to be too cold-hearted.",Pisces
"May 18, 2022 - Do you think your body reflects who you are, Pisces? If you have the feeling that it doesn't, it's probably because the image you have of yourself isn't quite right. Take a close look at yourself in order to readjust that image. You'll see that your body is the exact mirror of who you are at the moment. The alignment of the planets will help you see this more clearly now.",Pisces
"May 19, 2022 - Just when you're feeling good and solid in your plan, Pisces, something or someone may step in to rain on your parade. You could get the feeling today that you're taking one step forward and two steps back. Perhaps there's a feeling of doubt creeping into the picture. Try not to let these nagging, restrictive energies hold you back. Be confident about your abilities.",Pisces
"May 20, 2022 - Your mood should be quite good today, Pisces, and you'll be well supported by the people around you. The key is to bring intense feelings directly to the table as you experience them. You'll find that other people share similar emotions at this time. The combination of energies between you and those close to you is simply magical. Join together with others on elaborate projects and special events.",Pisces
"May 21, 2022 - This could be a good day to try relaxation techniques that are a little bit out of the ordinary. Who knows? Maybe you'll even learn something from these unorthodox methods. Why not explore shiatsu or polarity? These techniques can do wonders for restoring your energy, an element that has been in short supply for you lately. Give it a try. As the good doctor said, ""This won't hurt a bit.""",Pisces
"May 22, 2022 - You can cut through to the truth quite easily today, Pisces, so don't hesitate to do so. If you come to an intersection and no one seems to know who should go next, take the initiative and go. It might not be a bad idea to signal your intentions to the other drivers before you make your move. Being aggressive with your actions doesn't mean you have to be reckless.",Pisces
"May 23, 2022 - Attend to your duties today, Pisces. There's a pronounced sense of the passage of time and feeling that the days are slipping quickly by. Make sure you fit love and romance somewhere into the equation. You may experience a bit of resistance in this department at first, but that indicates that this is an area you need to explore and ultimately feel more comfortable with.",Pisces
"May 24, 2022 - You're filled with vitality today, Pisces. In other words, you're going to feel great about yourself! You're less afraid of meeting people, and you have fewer doubts about everything, including yourself! This is going to be a great day to consider working a little bit less and thinking a little bit more about what, specifically, is making you feel so good. That way, you can recreate the feeling tomorrow.",Pisces
"May 25, 2022 - Your head may be buzzing with activity, Pisces. It seems like the spotlight suddenly has been turned on. Your mind is on stage and your brainpower is being tested. Are you prepared for the challenge? Whether you're ready or not, it's here. Remember the importance of individuality. Don't become another typical cookie from the same old cookie cutter. Be your own person and think for yourself.",Pisces
"May 26, 2022 - It's time to review your dreams and fantasies, Pisces. It could be that you've been neglecting them lately. Perhaps things you've been working toward haven't exactly panned out the way you'd hoped. The good news is that things should be turning around in your favor starting today. Take control of your dreams and you'll find that you can get them moving forward again.",Pisces
"May 27, 2022 - Take care of the people around you, Pisces. Service to others is an important part of the day, as compassion and caring are at the forefront of your mind. Take this opportunity to become a reassuring caregiver for someone close who needs a nurturing shoulder. You'll win a great number of loyal friends to your side as you share your passionate nature with others.",Pisces
"May 28, 2022 - The last months have been very challenging - and there's a very good chance that you no longer feel up to meeting the challenges. If you've been yearning to modify something in your daily life, do it now, Pisces. The hour has come to make concrete changes. Regardless of whether the change you seek is at home or work, physical or emotional, don't be afraid to seriously upset your life.",Pisces
"May 29, 2022 - This is a good day for getting out of the trenches and into the air for a fresh, new perspective on a situation, Pisces. Don't dwell on things beneath or behind you. Keep looking up. Pick up the phone and call a close friend you haven't spoken with in a while. There may be a great deal of catching up to do. In times of global uncertainty, we need to remember the importance of maintaining contact with old buddies.",Pisces
"May 30, 2022 - If you woke up this morning and just wanted to stay in bed rather than start your day, know that you aren't alone, Pisces. Today you're experiencing a sensitive warmth that makes you feel vulnerable to the chilly wind of reality. Harsh words seem to cut more deeply than usual, making you wish you'd never left the cocoon of your bed. Surround yourself with supportive people, whether in person or remotely.",Pisces
"May 31, 2022 - Your emotions will feel stable today, Pisces, although an unexpected element might sneak into the equation. Be aware that people will be a bit more volatile. Although the situation may be calm and cool one minute, it could explode in the next minute. Try to stay centered all day so you don't get thrown off course by other people's erratic emotions. Social distancing could be your friend, providing a much-needed buffer.",Pisces
"Jun 1, 2022 - If you've considered a career in publishing, Pisces, this is the time to go for it. It's also a great day to enroll in law school, an advanced degree program, or any field of higher education. Love with someone from far away could well be in the offing. At the very least, you could make a new friend from a distant state or foreign land. This should be a satisfying day for you.",Pisces
"Jun 2, 2022 - Today you might feel the need to be of service to others. Your humanitarian instincts are high, Pisces, though you might tend to over-idealize the concept a little. It's wonderful to help those less fortunate, but often the process involves a heavy commitment of time and energy. If you decide to do this, it could transform your life in a profound way. Be prepared for some pretty heavy changes.",Pisces
"Jun 3, 2022 - Today you might need to execute some paperwork regarding money, Pisces. Bills might need to be paid, deposits made, or checks collected. Minor incidents could interrupt you, causing some frustration. Communication of all kinds, including those with people close to you, might go awry during the day. It doesn't change the positive turn your life is taking. Keep at it.",Pisces
"Jun 4, 2022 - Although you've been feeling especially strong physically over the past few days, Pisces, today you might feel a little under the weather. You could even experience some giddiness. This is nothing to worry about, but you should try to take it easy. Don't exercise if you don't feel up to it. Get some rest. Even if you have to postpone some chores, you'll be better off in the long run.",Pisces
"Jun 5, 2022 - The desire to acquire more knowledge is front and center today, Pisces. A virtual lecture or workshop might lead to plans for a future outing of some kind with friends or other members of a group you're affiliated with. Family members might also show an interest. You could all review the possibilities together and jot ideas. The energy and enthusiasm of everyone around you is high, so make the most of their ideas.",Pisces
"Jun 6, 2022 - Intense communication throughout the day could bring you closer to a friend or lover, Pisces. Conversations about a number of different subjects could increase your understanding of one another and leave you with a lot of wonderful memories of the day. If possible, you could drive into the country or just hang out together, too. Above all, have fun.",Pisces
"Jun 7, 2022 - Long-buried emotions from the past, some of them pleasant and some in need of release, could well up from your subconscious today, Pisces. This is likely to have an uplifting effect on your mental and emotional state, so don't fight it. It's also likely to release whatever hang-ups you might have about relationships. Therefore, you can expect all your involvements to thrive - particularly the romantic ones. Enjoy.",Pisces
"Jun 8, 2022 - Every once in a while, everyone must analyze his or her life. But you tend to be too pessimistic when you ponder yours. You get easily carried away, and you often exaggerate. Today, as you think about your life, try not to listen to that little voice in your head. Your life is far from being the way that you think it is.",Pisces
"Jun 9, 2022 - That little child you once were and that you're trying so desperately to forget is still causing you problems, Pisces. Why do you try so hard to deny that sweet and tender part of you that comes out even in your adult life? You'll forget about your faults, imperfections, and complexes more easily if you just remember your childhood fondly, and maybe even smile about it.",Pisces
"Jun 10, 2022 - You shouldn't try to fight the feelings that run through you today. Don't even try to rationalize them. These feelings are probably related to emotions dating back to your childhood. You shouldn't avoid or analyze them. There will be a lot of turmoil welling up inside you, Pisces. You should try to find some peace and quiet with special someone.",Pisces
"Jun 11, 2022 - Getting in touch with your closest friends could bring about some intense communication, with many revealing some of your deepest concerns, Pisces. Your thinking should be greatly influenced by feeling, so you might experience a high level of understanding that your friends are going to appreciate. This could well bring all of you closer together and increase future contact. Enjoy your day!",Pisces
"Jun 12, 2022 - A group with which you're affiliated with could suddenly seem to grow closer, and a family feeling could develop among its members. One of the members could suddenly appear to you in a new light, Pisces, and a romantic attraction might develop. Whether you pursue it or not depends on your situation, but you'll still feel closer to your friends now. Some intimate conversations could take place amid discussions of other matters.",Pisces
"Jun 13, 2022 - You have always tried to build up your health using traditional methods, and you take great care of yourself. But this morning you might feel a little curious. Indeed, there are so many different courses of treatment available. Why not inquire about alternative forms of medicine? You could learn a great deal today and benefit your health in the process.",Pisces
"Jun 14, 2022 - Your generosity and altruism will be put to the test over the next few days, Pisces. You'll probably help the underprivileged. After all, you've always felt concerned about humanitarian projects but have never gotten involved. Today this attitude will enable you to understand who you really are. You'll be able to learn a lot about your motivations and the keys to your success.",Pisces
"Jun 15, 2022 - A group you're affiliated with could meet or have a virtual/group chat today, Pisces. You should focus more on listening to what they have to say than on actively participating in discussions. You'll want to absorb every idea that comes up and seriously mull it over before expressing yourself. When you communicate, you should do it freely and openly. Your mind is both intuitive and logical, so expect to learn a lot.",Pisces
"Jun 16, 2022 - Matters involving creativity, romance, and children could require considerable thought today, Pisces. Some exciting new options may be available to you and your loved ones. You might be inclined to mull over the possibilities. You could consult others to get more opinions. For the most part, you'll want to decide on your own. In the meantime, you could keep yourself occupied by working on ongoing projects.",Pisces
"Jun 17, 2022 - There's a great day ahead of you, Pisces. You'll be blessed with the ability to solve problems, and others will come looking for you today. You'll listen, understand, and express empathy. You'll be wise enough to find solutions to any issues they present to you. After a day like this, you might ask yourself if you shouldn't work as a therapist.",Pisces
"Jun 18, 2022 - People will understand and appreciate your desire to stand out from the crowd today, Pisces. This isn't a sign of arrogance on your part. It's just that you're particularly perceptive right now and people need your good advice. Since you're ready to step into the spotlight and shine like the stars that are giving you all this wonderful energy, go for it. You'd kick yourself if you let this opportunity pass.",Pisces
"Jun 19, 2022 - You are very interested in technological breakthroughs and innovation, Pisces, especially if it has some benefit for individuals. Since you also concern yourself with social issues and subjects like psychology and spiritual therapies, you realize the importance of progress in these areas for the future. You also wonder where you fit in.",Pisces
"Jun 20, 2022 - Stress from overwork could have you feeling weaker than usual. You might be tempted to stay at home, get some rest, and recoup your energies. Do this if you can, Pisces. Otherwise, you may not be able to give your project the concentration it needs, and therefore may not accomplish as much as you think you should. If you feel you can't stay home, try to work alone so you won't be distracted.",Pisces
"Jun 21, 2022 - This is a good day to stand up for yourself and make it known that you aren't a pushover, Pisces.

Feel free to be more aggressive than you normally would. Show others your incredible worth.",Pisces
"Jun 22, 2022 - The planets align to make this a great day for you, Pisces. You should find that your mood is excellent and your mind focused.

If you've been suffering from any doubts lately, now is the time to take control of the situation and go for it.",Pisces
"Jun 23, 2022 - This is a good day to add spark to your life, Pisces. If things have seemed boring and stagnating lately, you may need to infuse a bit of excitement into the situation. Add flair and dynamism to the mix. Take matters into your own hands and actively pursue your goals. You have a strong inner sense of where you need to go. Trust your instincts and move in that direction. Don't hesitate.",Pisces
"Jun 24, 2022 - Success on all levels is filling your life and making you feel absolutely wonderful, Pisces. The downside of this is that you might be a little too conscientious. Are you putting in a lot of extra hours? Be discriminating about this. Don't work harder than you need to. You could stress yourself out to the point where you tax your strength too much. That won't get you anywhere. Pace yourself.",Pisces
"Jun 25, 2022 - You've been doing well, Pisces, but today you might be feeling more focused than ever. The path ahead seems clear and well defined. You're looking forward to the future with motivation and anticipation. You might be considering a travel adventure or perhaps going back to school for an advanced degree. Today is a good day to start doing some research and finalizing your plans. Go to it.",Pisces
"Jun 26, 2022 - You probably crave solitude, Pisces. Even though you may have committed to doing something for a friend or relative, now you find the idea irritating. You could have some tasks of your own that you'd rather work on, or you might simply want to go for a workout and burn off some tension. The latter idea is a good one. Perhaps if you exercise early, you'll feel more like fulfilling your obligations.",Pisces
"Jun 27, 2022 - There's a conflicting push-pull aspect at play that may leave you feeling a bit unsure of how to proceed, Pisces. On the one hand, you feel like you want to plan and get your emotions stabilized so you can function at full capacity. On the other hand, there may be something pulling you into the clouds. This is your heart talking. Listen to it and find a compromise between the two energies.",Pisces
"Jun 28, 2022 - Today you might hear about opportunities to increase your income, Pisces, either through your current employment, a new job, or perhaps a project of your own. You're likely to channel a great deal of energy and inspiration to this end. Others may want to pitch in and help you. You're liable to feel energetic and optimistic. This, in turn, can help you attract more opportunities. Go for it!",Pisces
"Jun 29, 2022 - Today is a day to shine, Pisces, so make sure you're giving it your all. Get the credit you deserve for all you do. Try not to fall into self-pity.

Make sure you aren't thrown off course by other people's whims.",Pisces
"Jun 30, 2022 - A good tip for you to remember is to be careful about what you say about others, Pisces. If you're talking about someone who isn't present, act as if he or she is. What is your motivation for saying those things? Is it necessary to speak in such a manner? A negative comment about someone else is going to resonate in the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"Jul 1, 2022 - You might experience a great deal of emotional confusion today, Pisces. There's a debate brewing inside you. You're having a hard time deciding whether to pursue the practical or the fanciful. Looking to others for help could only add to the confusion, so take their advice with a grain of salt. If nothing seems clear to you, then wait it out and proceed when you have a better handle on things.",Pisces
"Jul 2, 2022 - Your solid footing may become a bit unstable today, Pisces, but don't worry about it. Be a little more flexible and release your tightfisted grip on the situation. Infuse a bit of laughter and playfulness into things. You'll find that the exchange of ideas is a critical part of the day. Get out of the house and enjoy lighthearted conversations whenever possible.",Pisces
"Jul 3, 2022 - A great deal of attention will center on your emotions today, Pisces, although being centered in and of itself will be quite the challenge. You may feel like a yo-yo at the mercy of someone else's hand. Don't fall prey to victimization. Stand up for yourself even if it means that others are likely to get upset. You're responsible for your feelings and no one else's.",Pisces
"Jul 4, 2022 - You may have found yourself having some issues with food lately, Pisces. It could be that your sense of self-worth isn't at its highest and you're trying to make up for it by sabotaging your relationship with your body. Food is healthy nourishment that you need to survive. Your body deserves respect. You need to always give it the proper fuel that it requires to be healthy.",Pisces
"Jul 5, 2022 - Mix your reality with a bit of fantasy today, Pisces. Allow your feet to come off the ground for a little while. Give yourself a rest. Take some time to meditate and clear your mind of your daily worries. Calming, relaxing activities are the best way to spend the day. Spend time communicating with friends and feel free to go deep into conversations regarding outlandish subjects. Allow yourself to dream.",Pisces
"Jul 6, 2022 - Your Florence Nightingale side might make an appearance today, Pisces. Your default defense is to take care of yourself and others. That's fine, but make sure you do it in a way that doesn't deplete your vital life force. The key is to offer advice and then leave the situation. You aren't responsible for others' actions. Offer information but leave the final decision up to the person you're trying to help.",Pisces
"Jul 7, 2022 - Act on your instincts today, Pisces, and you won't go wrong. You may need to give up a bit of control and put logical thinking aside for the day. Let the wind take you where it wants you to go. Explore your mind and its interactions with others. You'll find that it will be just about impossible to solidify any plans. You're better off exploring options and comparing notes with others. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of thinking.",Pisces
"Jul 8, 2022 - You'll find little comfort in your emotions today, Pisces. You may want to simply stick to business. Concentrate on getting things done in your regular routine. Create a plan and stick to it. This isn't a day to deviate from the norm, nor is it a time in which you'll find sympathy from others. Stick close to home and take care of your personal business. Time is precious - don't waste it.",Pisces
"Jul 9, 2022 - Come out of serious mode for a day and let yourself laugh, Pisces. Sponsor a game night at your home and invite some good friends over to play cards and nibble on snacks until midnight, if possible. This is a day to have fun, so let loose and be free to express yourself in the best way you see fit. Realize how much power you have in your jovial nature.",Pisces
"Jul 10, 2022 - This is a great day to develop any latent talents you've wanted to explore, Pisces, particularly those involving the arts. You might want to try working with friends who have the same talent. This could not only lead to some good advice but also bring you two closer. However, this isn't a good day to deal with practical paperwork, so let that sort of thing go for a little while.",Pisces
"Jul 11, 2022 - It may be difficult to stay grounded today with all the information flying around and the emotions roiling in your heart. Try not to take things too seriously, Pisces. This is the key to maintaining a level head throughout the day. Do things with passion and take care of any detective work that needs to be done. There are important facts coming to you from unexpected sources.",Pisces
"Jul 12, 2022 - Your slow and steady approach may need a sharp kick in the pants today, Pisces. Don't withhold your opinions. This is a time to get it all out on the table, despite the tension that it may cause. Strong forces are at work, so don't be surprised if things get a bit more heated than you're used to. The fact is that incredible breakthroughs can be made through disagreements among different types of people.",Pisces
"Jul 13, 2022 - The possibility of some future houseguests might have you checking your home to see what needs to be done to make it presentable. It may need a few minor repairs, Pisces, and you could do some online shopping to dress the place up a little. Books might give you some workable ideas. Your mind might be working more quickly than your body, however. Take care not to push yourself too hard.",Pisces
"Jul 14, 2022 - Your financial affairs could look especially rosy now, Pisces. Some benefits are definitely coming your way, although everything isn't quite as promising as it seems. You could well find yourself with less than you were hoping for. Think of whatever gain may be coming as something extra, but don't count on it. That way, whatever comes will be a welcome bonus rather than an irritating disappointment.",Pisces
"Jul 15, 2022 - Relations with those you care about continue to be warm and supportive. Friends may want to pitch in and help you with a project, Pisces, or you could lend a hand to someone else. Strong bonds with others could be forged at this time, which might lead to firm and lasting friendships in the future. This is also a good day to turn your attention to repairing, redecorating, or refurnishing your home.",Pisces
"Jul 16, 2022 - Today might be a bit difficult, Pisces, because you aren't likely to be as productive as usual. You won't have much to say, and you'll feel sleepy and somewhat grumpy. In other words, it's the perfect day to go back to bed with that novel. Take a nap - or several naps - and follow your desire to do as little as possible. There will be plenty of time to catch up on work.",Pisces
"Jul 17, 2022 - New communications equipment may make whatever work you do that much easier to do, Pisces. You might have some doubts about your ability to use it, but don't worry. You'll be able to deal with it as well as anyone. You'll find that it will open up new doors for you, both with regard to compiling information and staying in contact with old and new friends. Go to it!",Pisces
"Jul 18, 2022 - You may be in an especially nurturing mood today, Pisces. You might reach out to every living thing around you, from plants to pets to friends, children, and romantic partners. There's a danger of being too helpful and supportive, which some could find stifling. Your loved ones like to see you relaxed and happy, so channel some energy into indulging yourself. Go for a massage or other treat. Live a little!",Pisces
"Jul 19, 2022 - You may be feeling a bit reserved today, Pisces, especially when it comes to issues involving love and romance. Follow your instincts and know that your hesitation isn't unfounded. Sometimes it's good to slow down and question the road you're on. Just don't doubt yourself to the point that you become too frustrated that you can't take the next big step forward.",Pisces
"Jul 20, 2022 - New opportunities to advance your professional standing may arise, Pisces. The aspects bode well for business and money. Promising new projects may present themselves. Your tendency to serve and nurture others should strengthen your work relationships, so morale on the job takes a tangible upswing at this time. Warmth and affection for friends, children, romantic partners, and even casual acquaintances should increase and enhance relationships.",Pisces
"Jul 21, 2022 - Here's a reminder that it's OK to be you. You may feel more centered than usual, which encourages you to stand up for yourself and say the things you must to people who need to hear them. There may have been recent arguments with a partner, but those should subside now, thanks to today's serene feelings. Perhaps you've gained greater insight into the cause of the tension. Share this with the person you've been arguing with.",Pisces
"Jul 22, 2022 - You might surprise a few people with your words and actions, which could seem out of character for you, Pisces. Don't be surprised if you don't think or act like your normal self. There is a streak of the oddball inside you that wants to have its day in the spotlight. Let that part of you shine through by wearing your plaid pants with a polka dot shirt and furry orange hat. Wear bright, expressive colors that show off your willingness to stand out in a crowd.",Pisces
"Jul 23, 2022 - Things should be going your way right now, Pisces. Feel confident about yourself and your decisions. Let your inner glow radiate outward and show people that you have a great deal of love to offer. Practice what you preach. You lose respect when you act contrary to the way in which you insist the people around you act. Feel your power from within as opposed to trying to get it from others.",Pisces
"Jul 24, 2022 - Your brain is likely to be working overtime, Pisces. Things were going along just fine until you suddenly ran into an unexpected snag that kept you from where you want to be.

Get some perspective.",Pisces
"Jul 25, 2022 - Don't be so nosy about others' affairs today, Pisces. If you were meant to be included in the conversation, you'd have been invited.

Realize that the only person you can control in that department is you.",Pisces
"Jul 26, 2022 - You might have to do a bit of adjusting today in order to experience a harmonious understanding with the people around you, Pisces.

"Jul 27, 2022 - Today you should work to tune into the larger, slower-moving trends in your life, Pisces. Consider making some long-term monetary and emotional investments. There is a great deal of prosperity available to you now, but beware of deception on the part of others. Watch out for fast talkers and people who promise everything yet deliver nothing. Have confidence that you can decipher what's real and what isn't.",Pisces
"Jul 28, 2022 - You'll find that your brain is extra sharp today and you have a greater sense of clarity regarding your purpose in life. It could be that your nurturing instinct is high and your general self-esteem depends on how useful you can be to the people around you. It may seem as if you're everyone's parent or watchful older sibling. Give people the advice they need to grow and be wiser.",Pisces
"Jul 29, 2022 - Regardless of how you feel today, Pisces, it's important to own up to your mistakes. Keep in mind that you're responsible for your actions.

Take bold action today in which you command control of the situation and hold yourself responsible for the consequences.",Pisces
"Jul 30, 2022 - This is going to be a rather intense day, Pisces. On the positive side, you'll accomplish a lot. On the less positive side, you may be exhausted by the end of the day. You're advised to try and pace yourself. Remain focused on what's truly important rather than let yourself get caught up in trivia. Keep the big picture in mind and the little things will take care of themselves.",Pisces
"Jul 31, 2022 - You seem to be filled with questions, Pisces. Some of them are big, some trivial. All you know is that they preoccupy you, and the answers aren't readily apparent. Don't fret.

Enjoy it.",Pisces

"Aug 3, 2022 - Don't get pulled off track by empty promises today, Pisces. Someone may try to sell you oceanfront property in the middle of Iowa. Beware of things that sound too good to be true. People may be talking quite a bit, but in reality, they probably have nothing to say. Don't waste your time trying to make sense of useless drivel. You've got more important things to do.",Pisces
"Aug 4, 2022 - Travel arrangements may have to be put off because of unexpected developments that keep you where you are, Pisces. You may be worried about the consequences, but don't waste your energy. You'll be able to make the necessary trip and accomplish whatever you're hoping to do - just not today. Worry will only stress you out. The only productive way to deal with this is to keep moving.",Pisces
"Aug 5, 2022 - The emotional swings that you could feel today might put a damper on your fantasy world, Pisces. Remember that it's up to you to nurture these dreams.

"Aug 6, 2022 - Your mind is buzzing like a bee, Pisces. You're apt to find that there's very little you can do to slow it down.

"Aug 7, 2022 - Have you been looking for a new job, Pisces? If so, you might hear of an opportunity from an unexpected source, perhaps at a social gathering, if possible.

Look into it and get all the facts before acting.",Pisces
"Aug 8, 2022 - Vivid dreams are likely to cause you to wake up feeling angry for no clear reason, Pisces. You might want to take a close look at your dreams and try to analyze them so you can understand the source of your anger and how best to get over it. Later today, some disconcerting news about money is likely to prove groundless, so don't get stressed out.",Pisces
"Aug 9, 2022 - Changes taking place in your home could cause some temporary frustration tense nerves on the part of family members, Pisces. Perhaps you're moving or refurnishing or trying to do a thorough cleaning and everyone is getting into everyone else's way. Just try to get the job done as quickly as possible. Once it's done, tempers will subside, and all will be well.",Pisces
"Aug 10, 2022 - Today a deep concern for others' feelings could have you lending a sympathetic ear to those in need of some understanding.

This could involve new people or equipment coming onto the scene or an entirely new project or course of action that you'd never have dreamed of.

"Aug 12, 2022 - Does your job have a good profit-sharing plan, Pisces, or do you own company stock? If so, expect to hear that its value has skyrocketed beyond what anyone had hoped. This is worthy of celebration. You and your colleagues should do just that. A romantic interest might offer congratulations. This trend is likely to continue. You might be a millionaire someday.",Pisces
"Aug 13, 2022 - A sum of money above and beyond your usual income could come your way. This could be a bonus, settlement, or even a gift of some kind.

This may seem like a daunting prospect, but you'll have the energy and enthusiasm in addition to the money. Go to it.",Pisces
"Aug 14, 2022 - You may feel like you're being tested in some way and must prove that what you're doing is valid and correct, Pisces. Fortunately, you should feel an emotional boost that will help you be confident about who you are, regardless of what other people think. The biggest tests are those that you give yourself. You are your toughest critic. Take concerted steps to go easier on yourself.",Pisces
"Aug 15, 2022 - If your lifestyle is very different from others, resist feeling self-conscious about it today, Pisces. Remember that you chose your life for specific reasons. Even if you're considering a change, there's no need to feel ashamed or embarrassed about where you are now. Everyone has to make his or her own way. If it conforms to the norm, that's fine. If it doesn't, that's fine, too.",Pisces

"Aug 17, 2022 - When was the last time you used a pen and paper, Pisces? The keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of writing's rhythmic motion is far more soothing and healing than people realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good. It unlocks places within that typing can't access. Try it.",Pisces
"Aug 18, 2022 - This is an excellent day to express your natural creativity, Pisces. The arts will more than likely be very important to you.

"Aug 21, 2022 - Try not to lose sight of your own projects or desires, Pisces. There's a great deal of power and manipulative energy in the air today that could throw you off course if you aren't careful.

"Aug 22, 2022 - There's a fiery tone to the day that can't be ignored, Pisces. You may find that adjustments need to be made in your own plan of attack in order to get on the same page with other people. Don't worry if things don't go according to your plans.

"Aug 23, 2022 - Your intuition is likely to be very keen today, Pisces. Accurate psychic insights could come to you thick and fast. Your imagination is also strong, and you might come up with ideas to enrich your home, work, or anything else on your mind. Don't be surprised if you seem to know what others will say before they even think of it. Write down any premonitions to verify later.",Pisces
"Aug 24, 2022 - Today you should be looking especially good and feeling particularly passionate and sensual, Pisces. This is a great day to buy new clothes online, as your fashion sense is probably right on target. Racy novels and romantic movies may seem more appealing than usual.

"Aug 25, 2022 - You may run into a great deal of frustration if you try to fight the current circumstances, Pisces. The key is to take whatever situation you're in and make the best of it. Whining and moping about your position won't make things better. You have great gifts to be proud of and thankful for, so don't throw them away by thinking that they have no outlet. Create your own reality.",Pisces
"Aug 26, 2022 - The key for you today is to not take things too seriously, Pisces. You'll find that the more you deliberate over a decision, the harder it will be for you to make. You may miss your opportunity while you're weighing the facts. Be spontaneous. Try something you've never tried before. Vary your experiences so things don't get boring. Variety is the spice of life.",Pisces
"Aug 27, 2022 - All things domestic are highlighted, Pisces. It could be that you've finally called the plumber or set out to do those household repairs yourself. New people are likely to come into your life. In fact, they may try to finagle an invitation for dinner, if possible. All you can expect today is the unexpected. Have some extra food on hand and see what happens.",Pisces
"Aug 28, 2022 - Travel of any kind might be virtually impossible today, Pisces. Airports could be jammed, flights delayed, and planes plagued with mechanical problems.

You're likely to go nuts otherwise.",Pisces
"Aug 29, 2022 - It you’re able to attend a social event today, Pisces, you won't feel like talking.

If you're creative about time management, you'll be able to find some time.",Pisces
"Sep 1, 2022 - Your mind may be a little cloudy most of the day, Pisces, and you could find it hard to ground yourself. It may be that you're trying to navigate by the stars, but unfortunately, the clouds have moved in and there are no reference points to be seen.

You and your co-workers could have some momentary fears about job security, but they're probably unwarranted. Your security will survive these events, and you'll probably be better off than you were before.",Pisces
"Sep 4, 2022 - There may be some tension today as you try to stabilize your emotions, Pisces. There could be a force at work out there that's rather impersonal and detached. More than likely, this force doesn't relate as much to how you feel as it does to how well you've done the job. Stick to your tasks in a practical, grounded manner.",Pisces
"Sep 5, 2022 - Pisces, a long-awaited letter or call could come from a love partner or beloved friend, bringing much happiness into your life.

Don't let that get in the way of seeing these revelations objectively. They could be important.",Pisces
"Sep 6, 2022 - Today is a good day to ask for a raise or consider other ways to increase your income, Pisces. Superiors will be in a receptive mood and likely feeling more benevolent than usual. This is a good time to study and consider investment possibilities, but it isn't a good time to make investments. The facts may differ from what you read or hear. Wait about a week before deciding.",Pisces
"Sep 7, 2022 - Perhaps you've been planning a trip or a return to school for a long time. However, Pisces, a rather disturbing letter or phone call could jeopardize your plans and leave you teetering on the edge of disappointment. If you look at the situation carefully, you may find that it doesn't set you back that much. You can take care of it without sacrificing what you want.",Pisces
"Sep 8, 2022 - There's an adventurous side to today that you should latch onto. Try not to get weighed down by the little things in your life that don't really matter much.

There may be a few surprises today, so be ready for anything.",Pisces
"Sep 9, 2022 - You like to be honest with those you care about, but today you're likely to be a bit too honest. Don't be too quick to take offense and watch the tendency to be too blunt.

"Sep 10, 2022 - Don't let others' bad moods get you down, Pisces. And don't feel it's your responsibility to cheer them up. Their moodiness is their business, not yours.

"Sep 11, 2022 - Your health should be in top shape today, Pisces. You're likely to feel physically, emotionally, and spiritually strong and ready to tap into your inner power.

Take heart from past success, continue as you are, and enjoy your day.",Pisces
"Sep 12, 2022 - Stress could have you feeling uncommunicative today. You probably aren't going to want to talk to anyone, even your dearest friend, Pisces. This might prove difficult, as people around you are going to ask for advice and help. Keep your cool. This feeling will pass, and you won't want anyone to think you're upset. Go to lunch alone, and tonight crash into bed with a good book.",Pisces
"Sep 13, 2022 - A financial windfall might open new doors for you, Pisces, and you could consider making some major changes in your life. You might think about moving to a nicer home.

Don't hesitate.",Pisces
"Sep 14, 2022 - Ask for help if you need it, Pisces. Your nature is to serve others, but in order to maintain that energy, make sure that you're taken care of as well.

Pamper yourself tonight with a hot bath and a good meal.",Pisces
"Sep 15, 2022 - Yes, you may have another cookie, Pisces. Enjoy it and don't feel guilty. Guilt is useless. Today, get rid of regret. Express your emotions but don't dwell on them. Your sensitivity is acute, so put up your psychic shield. You might pick up on others' intense energy, so be careful. Sympathize with others, but don't take on their garbage. They need to take out their own trash.",Pisces

Dress in your favorite colors and have fun.",Pisces
"Sep 18, 2022 - You could be quite busy today as friends from far away call for long-overdue conversations, Pisces. You'll probably spend as much time as you can catching up on the latest news, but don't go overboard. Your friends want to talk to you, but they aren’t judgmental. Talk about whatever is on your mind, and don’t worry about making a good impression. The truth is more important than bragging. Enjoy visiting.",Pisces
"Sep 19, 2022 - You might not get the things done that you want to do today, Pisces, but don't sweat it. Go easy on yourself if you still have a few unchecked things on the list tonight. People may pop out of nowhere and demand your attention for much of the time. Listen, be present, and try not to think of the things that aren't getting done. Focus on those things that are getting done.",Pisces
"Sep 20, 2022 - Does your house look like a cyclone hit it? Your tidy nature should drive you to clean it up.

Once you finish, you'll probably find that the place looks beautiful, better than it did before it was messed up. Something good can indeed come out of chaos.",Pisces
"Sep 21, 2022 - There could be trouble brewing in the workplace, Pisces. Some of your colleagues neither like nor trust each other and find it impossible to work together.

If it seems workable, go for it!",Pisces
"Sep 24, 2022 - A friend may have some juicy gossip for you, Pisces. Perhaps someone is getting married. You aren't the type to put too much stock in gossip, but your friend could be so convincing that you believe everything. Be skeptical! What you're hearing may not be outright lies, but it could be exaggerated. Wait until you see the people in question before accepting it as truth.",Pisces
"Sep 25, 2022 - The time is right for all things financial, Pisces. If you've been thinking of signing a contract to accept a job or purchase a piece of property, go ahead.

Correct this and you'll be unstoppable!",Pisces
"Sep 26, 2022 - Have you been considering working more at home, Pisces? If so, today you might decide to do just that. An opportunity could pave the way for new jobs you could do at home, in your own space, among your own belongings. This could add to your sense of security.

"Sep 27, 2022 - A call form someone you haven’t heard from in a while could generate mixed feelings, Pisces. On the one hand, you're probably glad to resume contact with this person.

Talk to another friend about how you feel so you can enjoy your evening.",Pisces
"Sep 28, 2022 - A lot of creative work may need to be finished by today, Pisces. If you're professionally involved with writing, a deadline may loom. It could be difficult to get it done because family members and friends could constantly call and text, which keeps you from concentrating. The best course of action might be to go somewhere quiet, like a library, and do your work there. Think about it!",Pisces
"Sep 29, 2022 - This is a good day to reflect on the past weeks and get some perspective, Pisces. You've probably been working too hard and neglecting other priorities in your life. Give yourself this day to relax and talk with friends and relatives. Spend the day chatting, laughing, and unwinding. Don't obsess about tasks that wait for you at the office. They aren't going anywhere.",Pisces
"Sep 30, 2022 - You may discover an untapped talent today, Pisces. Perhaps there's a new machine in the office and you're the only one who can figure out how to use it.

"Oct 3, 2022 - Don't get so stuck in your ways today that you insist on having the one true answer without really considering the options.

"Oct 4, 2022 - Get on the fast track and use your powerful words and creative mind to make quick decisions that are mindful yet spontaneous. If you get in a pinch today, Pisces, don't worry about it.

"Oct 8, 2022 - You're likely now on the brink of completing a major move of some sort. Your first reaction may be to sit in solitary deliberation as you wrestle with the pros and cons of each piece of the situation. Try not to overload your head with too many details.

"Oct 9, 2022 - You may feel like you desperately need something, Pisces, yet you're unsure as to what it is exactly. Someone close to you may be trying to fit the missing puzzle piece into place, but this may be next to impossible if it's unclear which piece is actually missing.

"Oct 10, 2022 - Are things getting a little bit crazy, Pisces? Too many tasks and too many people vying for your attention could have your nerves stretched as taut as violin strings. Try to get outside for a while. Treat yourself to a nice takeout lunch or do a little online shopping. Take a good long nap. Whatever seems so urgent isn't worth sacrificing your peace of mind. Try to stay focused!",Pisces
"Oct 11, 2022 - A lot of paperwork might need attention today, Pisces. You might throw a lot of your focus and energy into getting it all done. Stimulating conversations with colleagues could keep your mind occupied so you avoid boredom. You could take a walk at the end of the day since you're apt to encounter so much new information that you will want to clear your head in order to absorb it all.",Pisces
"Oct 12, 2022 - A book or movie about a foreign country could capture your imagination and make that country seem especially appealing, Pisces. You might toy with the idea of taking a trip there in the future. If you're serious, it might be a good idea to start making your tentative plans. You're in a particularly practical frame of mind and have the enthusiasm to do it. Have fun browsing through travel brochures and maps.",Pisces
"Oct 13, 2022 - Career and financial success might have paved the way for you to fulfill some of your fondest dreams, Pisces.

But try and do it gently, especially where family is concerned.",Pisces
"Oct 15, 2022 - A friend could tell you about an exciting new person for whom you feel a very powerful physical attraction when you see their picture, Pisces. Your first conversation could prove exciting but stay calm and remain objective. If your feelings are too obvious, he or she could well lose interest before anything has time to develop! Just be yourself, enjoy the discussion, and have fun. That's all you need do at this point.",Pisces
"Oct 16, 2022 - Don't be surprised if the old-fashioned, practical solution doesn't make the grade today, Pisces. Probably the new devices and special electronic shortcuts will be the most impressive thing going. This is the classic case of the new, improved version replacing the old, slow one. You need to upgrade your system sooner or later, so you might as well do it now.",Pisces
"Oct 17, 2022 - Answers may not be crystal clear today, Pisces. They probably won't be laid out in a neat and organized manner. Get out in the open air and join friends for a long bike ride. Fly a kite or feel the wind blow through your hair on top of a mountain peak. The answer is flowing through the air around you. Stop looking down at the ground for the information you seek.",Pisces
"Oct 18, 2022 - You might want to escape the frenzy of the day by going shopping, Pisces. Align yourself with partners and allies who share your views. Try to keep the disagreements to a minimum. There is enough tension and war raging in the world around you today that you don't need to add to the negative force by contributing disputes and ailments to the situation.",Pisces
"Oct 19, 2022 - You've had a strong propensity for war lately, Pisces. Your drive toward getting things done has rallied and you're anxious to make progress. The problem is that you might have to hold back a bit today, since there is a great force at work encouraging to you to take a break from your current trajectory. Slow down and make a plan instead of just plowing blindly ahead toward the unknown.",Pisces
"Oct 20, 2022 - There should be no doubt in your mind about which way to proceed, Pisces. Don't let self-doubt sneak into the picture. Your mind is sensitive and alert, so trust it. Take the lead when you feel confident about a situation. Make sure to eat plenty of protein-rich foods. They'll help stabilize and bring you another step closer to the realization of your dreams.",Pisces
"Oct 21, 2022 - Difficult challenges that have been lingering on the sidelines will probably become more prominent today, Pisces. There is a strong possibility that things will come to a head. The problem was easy to overlook at first, but now that it has taken on a life of its own, you may have to consult someone who is more of an expert on these types of situations than you are.",Pisces
"Oct 22, 2022 - Demands made by friends, children, or the special person in your life might have you feeling like you're moving in a dozen different directions at once. You may feel unfocused and scattered. You usually enjoy serving others, Pisces, but today you need to concentrate a little more on yourself. Show others how to help themselves and then go and do something you want to do. You deserve it!",Pisces
"Oct 23, 2022 - Legal matters may be on your mind today, Pisces. Maybe your insecurities are blowing a certain difficulty all out of proportion. You need to view the entire situation a little more objectively. If you can find someone in the know, ask him or her to fill you in on the facts. You will be relieved to know you've been making mountains out of molehills. For now, try to relax and lighten up a little.",Pisces
"Oct 24, 2022 - Is your workplace upgrading its equipment? Are you in the process of increasing your technology skills? Today's planets show that success and advancement through technology are definitely in the offing for you, Pisces. If you've been thinking about purchasing a computer, do it today if you can. Whatever your goals, you can harness current innovations to help them along. Give it some thought!",Pisces
"Oct 25, 2022 - Today you might feel a bit bloated and slow, Pisces, which could interfere with your daily routine. You could also feel unmotivated about work. You might not feel like exercising, but it's important that you do it anyway. Moving the body can clear your head and put you in the proper frame of mind to get on with your day. It can also help purge your tissues of all the excess toxins.",Pisces
"Oct 26, 2022 - Problems with machines could have your nerves on edge. This may be one day when everything seems to break. Some problems you might be able to fix yourself, Pisces, but at least one may involve something that has to be replaced. This might be the one you need the most right now. Think of it as a sign from the universe that you should do something else. That's the only way to stay sane.",Pisces
"Oct 27, 2022 - Information that comes your way today could launch you into a search for truth, Pisces. Perhaps this is a new business-related idea that you want to explore. It could be a new philosophical interest, and you will want to learn as much as you can about it. Whichever it is, your mind is sharp, so you're likely to finish the day a lot more knowledgeable than you were when it began.",Pisces
"Oct 28, 2022 - A phone conversation with someone who lives far away might have you feeling a bit sad, reflecting on how much you miss that person. This can lead to pondering about your life.

You will consider every detail.",Pisces

"Oct 30, 2022 - Your words may fall sharply on someone's ears today, so be aware of the impact you can have, Pisces. However, this doesn't mean that you need to dilute your message with lies in order to avoid the true topic of conversation. Just be conscious of the fact that a strong emotional response is apt to result when you open up to the truth and tell it like it is.",Pisces
"Oct 31, 2022 - Your mind could be going in many directions, Pisces. Direct your energy toward small projects that require intellect. Your energy is likely to come in waves, so use it wisely when you have it, and feel free to take a break when you don't. Tell your boss that you will be much more productive if you have a 20-minute break in the afternoon in order to recharge.",Pisces
"Nov 1, 2022 - Powerful issues arise in your life that make it difficult to find peace, Pisces. Perhaps your first tendency is to confide in your partner. More than likely, this person is contributing to the difficulties you're now having. Your best bet is to spend some time alone. If you're already alone, so much the better. Cherish this time instead of letting it make you mad.",Pisces
"Nov 2, 2022 - Electrical or plumbing problems with your house might come up. Call a professional, Pisces. Don't try to fix it yourself, because you could make it worse. Friends might want to visit but tell them to wait until another day. Discussions could quickly deteriorate into arguments today. This is a great day to work quietly alone on whatever interests you the most.",Pisces
"Nov 3, 2022 - You're entering a period of doubt, especially about your love life. You like your relationships and feelings to be clear. You may think a lot about your relationships over the next few days. Are you sure you've chosen the right person? Are his or her feelings sincere? Could you live without this person? The next two months will bring you the answers. Don't forget, no one is perfect.",Pisces
"Nov 4, 2022 - Today, Pisces, you can expect to be somewhat more enterprising in your relationships. You may find new friends or enjoy spending quality time with some old ones, if possible.

"Nov 5, 2022 - You have a creative and artistic nature that you might want to put to good use today, Pisces. You could have some good ideas for home improvements.

When it comes to artistic endeavors, you definitely have the touch.",Pisces
"Nov 6, 2022 - You may have been feeling more emotional lately, Pisces. Today a fanciful energy could sweep you off your feet and into another realm entirely. Feel free to take off for at least a little while in order to gain a better perspective on the issues at hand. Strong, forceful powers are urging you to let someone else take the reins on a particular project.",Pisces
"Nov 7, 2022 - This day isn't likely to be the highlight of your week, Pisces. You may be aware of constraints at work or home. You're quite likely to hanker for an appropriate reward for your labor. Any type of recognition would be nice at this point. This is a good day to define new personal and professional goals. They'll sustain you through your unending chores.",Pisces
"Nov 8, 2022 - For the past several days, Pisces, you've been fairly lucky in financial and material terms. But the day ahead will be an exception. If you're planning to make an investment, sign a contract, or purchase a major item, postpone it until another day. You may as well resign yourself to this fate and be grateful that you were spared the chance to make a mistake!",Pisces
"Nov 9, 2022 - Obviously, you have an important role to play, Pisces. The mood today may be somewhat frustrating, but the way you handle it will earn you rewards and recognition in your workplace or at school. Your strength, self-control, and stability made the difference between success and failure. You can and should be proud of yourself.",Pisces
"Nov 10, 2022 - Today you may be feeling a little surer of yourself than usual. You can be fairly shy and reserved. Today you should try and make people a little more aware of you, to take you seriously. It's time that people respected you more, especially the people around you. Try to think of yourself before you think of other people. You're worth it!",Pisces
"Nov 11, 2022 - Have fun with loved ones, Pisces. Put your worries aside. Don't think of the possible negative consequences of having a good time. Focus on the fun and excitement of the moment.

Hold your head high.",Pisces
"Nov 12, 2022 - As a Pisces, you have an innate gift for healing and calming other people in crisis situations. If this isn't what you do for a living, you should think about doing something with this natural talent. The positions of the planets today may be telling you to think about this in more concrete terms. If you're interested in herbal therapy, for example, this could be the perfect time to learn more.",Pisces
"Nov 13, 2022 - Your intuition should be very high right now, Pisces, as is your power of manifestation. Today you need to try to curb your thoughts and only think beautiful things, because you might find that whatever you think about seems to manifest! Some powerful dreams and visions can open up new lines of intellectual exploration for you that can have a potent effect on your immediate future. Go to it.",Pisces
"Nov 14, 2022 - Today you might feel inspired to help others less fortunate, Pisces. The opportunity to do some volunteer work could come your way, perhaps for a church, charity, or other humanitarian organization. Or you could throw yourself into an artistic discipline. Either way, you're likely to enjoy yourself immensely and meet some interesting people in the process. Fundraising could be involved in some way.",Pisces
"Nov 15, 2022 - Be tactful when speaking today, Pisces. With this day's energy, it's important that you take the time to think about how your words affect the person you're talking to. It can be easier than usual to say the wrong thing, especially if you're in the position of telling someone something you think might not go over too well. Avoid comments that suggest criticism of the person rather than the deed.",Pisces
"Nov 16, 2022 - If you're feeling irritable and wrung out today, Pisces, it may be a result of putting far too much pressure on yourself. It might be wise to take a look at the expectations you have of yourself. Consider if you would you place the same demands on those closest to you. If the answer is no, it's time to revamp your life to suit the one you're closest to - you.",Pisces
"Nov 17, 2022 - You may be feeling emotionally good, Pisces, but unfortunately the people around you don't seem to share this feeling. Your first instinct may be to sacrifice yourself in order to make the path easier for the next guy. Remember that other people need to learn how to do things on their own. If someone is in a bad mood, let them be in a bad mood. You may be better off spending the day alone.",Pisces
"Nov 18, 2022 - You may have had some emotional disappointments lately, but today will restore your faith in love. All you need to do is act. Your amazing lucidity and realism keep you from hoping for the impossible. You'd rather go to work to attain your goals than dilly-dally with illusions. Indeed, you're more likely to get results from yourself than from other people.",Pisces
"Nov 19, 2022 - You can never be anyone other than who you are, Pisces! That's the way it is, and you can't change it. Other members of your family may have dreamed of getting free of a duty or a moral lesson, but these dreams don't apply to you. Your dreams of being someone else are like phantoms that have come back to haunt you. Simply brush them away!",Pisces
"Nov 20, 2022 - It seems that the new planetary lineup has just opened up some doors that had previously been shut. You revel in the confidence that people have in you. It isn't that your abilities have changed, just your attitude! People trust you because you exhibit more self-confidence. It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Hold on to it at all costs.",Pisces
"Nov 21, 2022 - The latest equipment might suddenly be available to you. It's likely to make life easier and more interesting. It could also open doors to make new friends and find new opportunities. Increased income is also a possibility. You could stumble on some surprising information, Pisces, and this could set your mind going in a new direction. Today promises a lot of stimulation.",Pisces
"Nov 22, 2022 - Are you tired, Pisces? It's no wonder. You're so eager to be useful that you've run yourself ragged over the past few weeks. As you may have noticed, the world is so apathetic now that every movement requires enormous effort on your part. Why not settle down and rest today? That would be the wisest and most reasonable thing to do. You will still be needed tomorrow.",Pisces
"Nov 23, 2022 - You're going to be a valuable asset to others today because of your rational mind and ability to think things through clearly. The stubborn forces around you aren't going to bend, but you have the unique ability to do so. Do your best to avoid fights, even though it will be tempting for you and others to want to let off some steam.",Pisces
"Nov 24, 2022 - Your imagination might conjure stories or pictures that you want to memorialize through writing or painting, but a lack of self-confidence might discourage you. However, it's probably a good idea to do it anyway. These ideas come from deep inside you. Giving them shape could represent a release from old traumas. Keep your work hidden in a drawer if you don't like it.",Pisces
"Nov 25, 2022 - Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, Pisces. The problem with the energy today is that there may be some sticks and stones tossed in your direction. Be on the lookout for such objects. There are powerful forces operating that are charged with emotional aggression. War may break out if you aren't careful. Try to maintain the peace.",Pisces
"Nov 26, 2022 - You aren't the only one who can solve your problems, Pisces. Trust that there are others who are capable of understanding. Those who want to help you are motivated only by love, with no ulterior motives. It's in your nature to be skeptical, but these people do exist. And guess what? You could communicate with one of them today!",Pisces
"Nov 27, 2022 - When the day is done, you will look back on it as an unusual one, Pisces. Wild ideas sprouted in your head like mushrooms. You may have imagined leaving immediately for a trip around the world, or drawn up plans for a housekeeping invention, or visualized an entirely new opening in the online world. Don't dismiss these ideas as unrealistic. They are not.",Pisces
"Nov 28, 2022 - Get things taken care of in the morning so you can be carefree and laid back in the evening. It's important for you to square things away in your head so you can communicate important information to others later. Feel free to take an unconventional approach. It's important to march to the beat of your own drum and not anyone else's.",Pisces
"Nov 29, 2022 - Put your foot down today, Pisces. Don't let others push you around. It could be that you're used to letting people have their way in order to keep the peace. The problem with this is that your dreams and goals may get lost in the shuffle. Don't lose sight of your true destination. There's much more to life than you might see on the surface. Dig deeper.",Pisces
"Nov 30, 2022 - There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension, Pisces. Did you dare to express some contrary intellectual opinion? In any case, it looks like your self-confidence is stronger than usual right now. Go ahead and express any complaints or opinions you may have been keeping to yourself. But try and do it gently, especially where your family is concerned.",Pisces
"Feb 4, 2023 - A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Pisces, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",Pisces
"Dec 1, 2022 - Unguarded words on the part of a younger person might lead to upset. If the words are directed at you, don't take them seriously. The person doesn't know any better. If the words are directed at someone else, don't be tempted to lash out at the person who said them. Correct him or her gently. Either way, keep it to yourself and then forget it. It isn't worth the stress.",Pisces
"Dec 2, 2022 - There may be too much fiery energy in the day to make you feel comfortable with the situation, Pisces. Instead of trying to resist this powerful force, it would be better if you embraced it. Use this day to draw out some of your inner flame and let it radiate toward the people you care about the most. This is a day to take action on your feelings instead of swallow them without a word.",Pisces
"Dec 3, 2022 - Your self-esteem may be challenged by a fast-paced talker or unpleasant situation, Pisces. Don't accept things as they appear at first glance. There's a much deeper meaning brewing below the surface, and you'd be foolish not to recognize this when it comes around. Stick to your guns and stay grounded. Newfangled devices and big promises may not be all they're advertised to be.",Pisces
"Dec 4, 2022 - Maintain a positive attitude, Pisces, and things will naturally flow your way. Tell a few jokes and keep things light and energetic. You will find that you can multitask very well, and you have the ability to make everyone smile. Don't shy away from things - move toward them. Put away your self-doubt and be more proactive in your approach to everything you encounter.",Pisces
"Dec 5, 2022 - This is a good day to look at the big picture and discuss your ideas with others, Pisces. As you walk down the street, make sure you pay attention to what's going on around you. If you continue to be preoccupied by one issue, you may never see some of the other important pieces of the greater whole even though they're obvious to everyone else.",Pisces
"Dec 6, 2022 - You will float today, Pisces. You won't talk, you will be sleepy, and your mood won't be the best. OK, perfect! Get back into your novel, take several siestas, and do as little as possible, because that's what you want to do. Don't worry, busy beaver, this period will pass. And you know what? You aren't alone here. It happens to everyone from time to time. Flow with it.",Pisces
"Dec 7, 2022 - If you're involved with the arts, the day ahead will be a bright one for you, Pisces. You feel a strong desire to bring people together in pursuit of some artistic endeavor. Listen to your longings. You're likely to be a sharp talent scout, or at the very least, a person who is able to enhance other people's talents.",Pisces
"Dec 8, 2022 - You might wake up feeling a little under the weather, perhaps too tired to go anywhere, and you'll want to stay in. Perhaps this is the best course of action for today. You may be tired and a bit stressed out, Pisces, and more vulnerable than usual to any bugs may be going around at this time. Drink lots of juices and get some rest. Tomorrow you will probably feel much better.",Pisces
"Dec 9, 2022 - You could be feeling especially sociable today. Maybe there's a virtual party of some kind you want to be invited to. You could hear some good news, and there is probably some truth to it, but take everything you hear through the grapevine with a grain of salt. Not everything you hear is based on fact. If you can, go to someone in a position to know and find out from him or her.",Pisces
"Dec 10, 2022 - Plans for a trip could go awry today because of circumstances beyond your control. A postponement might be necessary. This might prove very frustrating for you because you've been anxious to get going. Don't question the workings of the universe, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Whatever setbacks you suffer today might in the long run prove to be blessings in disguise.",Pisces
"Dec 11, 2022 - Regardless of how much the storm seems to be raging out of control, you will be able to handle it, Pisces. Have confidence in your grounded nature. There's a reason why you take the time to address the details and carefully plan your moves. Today is one day when you will see the rewards of your diligent actions, especially in love, beauty, and your deepest emotions.",Pisces
"Dec 12, 2022 - You may find that things are much lighter than they were the past couple days, Pisces. This is a good time to let your physical body take a rest and let your mind and fantasy world take over. Take a hot bath and soak for a while. Relax your brain and detach from your duties and obligations. Tread lightly and don't worry so much about what you need to do tomorrow. Concentrate on today.",Pisces
"Dec 13, 2022 - There are a couple important issues that you may need to resolve, Pisces. Take an active role in the department of love and romance.

Strive to create peace through honest assertiveness.",Pisces
"Dec 14, 2022 - Take care of yourself and your needs, Pisces. There's an advantage to making sure your emotions are cared for and stable before you try to heal others.

Don't wait until the last minute to tell someone exactly how you feel about the situation.",Pisces
"Dec 15, 2022 - Your thoughts may be scattered and frantic early in the day, Pisces, but things should settle down by evening.

Don't set yourself up for failure by biting off more than you can chew.",Pisces
"Dec 16, 2022 - Today is a terrific day in which you should find that things work very smoothly. You have a hardheaded approach that will help you get down to business and get things done.

The intensity behind your words reflects your passion.",Pisces
"Dec 18, 2022 - It's important to take a hard look at yourself and know where you're going, Pisces. A little self-analysis never hurt anyone, especially when you feel like you aren't getting anywhere. But you tend to go a little overboard with self-criticism. Take today to try and ignore that little voice in your head, or even prove it wrong!",Pisces
"Dec 19, 2022 - Whether you acknowledge it or not, there's a child inside you who needs tending, Pisces. You're proud of the person you've become - and well you should be. But you're the product of who you once were. Today's planetary positions suggest you acknowledge all parts of your past - the good and the bad. Only after you've integrated all the elements can you be the person you're meant to be.",Pisces
"Dec 20, 2022 - Pisces, you shouldn't even try to find a reasonable explanation for what goes on around you today. There isn't one.

Instead, take the time to revitalize yourself in the intimacy of your home or at a friend's, if possible.",Pisces
"Dec 21, 2022 - Today could be the day you've been waiting for, Pisces. Realize that you have the gentle, sincere nature necessary to sweet-talk your way through any situation.

"Dec 22, 2022 - Initiate a deep, meaningful conversation with someone you've lost touch with, Pisces. It could be that a long and ugly point of contention is on the brink of resolution.

Find a connection with someone that you didn't know was there.",Pisces
"Dec 23, 2022 - You're conscientious where your health is concerned. You're one of the rare few who exercise and eat nutritious meals. Today you might want to expand your repertoire of medical remedies. If you've been struggling to shake a cold or allergy, consider some alternative medicines. They're moving more into the mainstream. Chinese herbs and acupuncture could just be what the New Age doctor ordered!",Pisces
"Dec 24, 2022 - You have strong humanitarian instincts, Pisces. You think of your fellow humans more than most. This, combined with your intuition and empathy, makes you well suited for the healing professions. If you've felt a bit disgruntled at work lately, it may be that you're in the wrong career.

"Dec 27, 2022 - What a great day for you! You seem to have the innate listening abilities of a therapist or counselor. Everyone comes to you with their problems or to cry on your proverbial shoulder. They know that you will listen without judgment. Have you ever thought about doing something like this for a living? Perhaps today will make you think about it.",Pisces
"Dec 28, 2022 - Today you may get the opportunity to feel proud of yourself. But don't let things get too out of hand. It isn't often that you allow yourself this little bit of narcissism. Everything you say will be pertinent, and people will let you know. For once, the stars are giving you the opportunity to cater to your own ego, so take advantage of it!",Pisces
"Dec 29, 2022 - You are very interested in all kinds of professions that concern humans, Pisces - medicine, psychology, or any kind of spiritual therapy. You will be very sensitive to the great opening toward the future that comes along today. The planetary alignment initiates progress in all areas of human existence. Keep your eyes and ears wide open.",Pisces
"Dec 30, 2022 - Intense emotions are apt to dominate the scene today, Pisces. Don't do anything halfway. It's time to give it your all or nothing. You have the power to cut to the heart of the issue.
